**– STORY –**

A lowly child beggar, a noble prince, a monster viewed as the enemy of the entire world. If you possess all three identities at the same time, which identity would you choose to help you earn a better ending?

Thales did not have the answer.

He only knew that he came to a different and magnificent world, and he had to face a future that was as difficult to handle as a nightmare.

The glorious Empire had already been destroyed for one thousand years, the dying royal family suffered many problems, the legendary sacred battle had plenty of conspiracies, the divided world was in chaos.

But Thales had nothing.

The only thing he had left was an unswerving determination to preserve his own identity, bravery which would allow him to survive in a perilous situation, and a belief that he would never submit to principles he did not believe.

“A King does not gain respect by virtue of his bloodline. The bloodline’s glory rests on the deeds of the King.”

Darkness will baptize light. Fire will create true steel. The forbidden prince’s story starts here.

Chapter 1   
Beggar

Arc 1: Return of the Blood

"That is why Baudrillard considers 'things' and 'requirements' as false symbols. He criticized Marx's labor theory of value1, believing he had fallen into the trap of capitalism and political economy. He then even proposed his own idea of political economy." Wu Qiren finished his presentation. He opened up his last slide and nodded his thanks to the teacher and his classmates. Upon the teacher's signal, he left the podium and awaited the next classmate's presentation.

"Thales\!"

The next moment, former postgraduate student Wu Qiren woke up from his dream.

He was curled up, lying in a cold hollowed-out hole in the wall. He could feel the cold wind blowing from the gaps.

Wu Qiren sighed. It had been five years but he still dreamt of his past life. His previous life was boring but it was definitely better than his current miserable situation.

"Thales\! Thales\!" A large hand stretched into the hole in the wall and grabbed Wu Qiren's ear before roughly pulling him out from that small and damaged place.

It was a dilapidated house. The bright stars in the night could be seen in the sky through the half-collapsed rooftop but the positions of the stars looked unfamiliar.

Wu Qiren could not hold out against that rough hand as he was only seven years old.

He was dragged on the rough brick floor. His knees hurt from the friction against the floor but he did not make a single noise. This was because the cruel Quide was especially intolerant with the wailing of children. It was said that he once broke the legs of a six-year- old girl who had cried for food.

"I've already asked Rick. The money you collected was five coppers less than last week\! You've stashed some away\!" Quide was angry and looked as red as the mane of a lion. His protruding nose made him look even more ferocious.

Wu Qiren was flung to the ground. His gray eyes looked at the holes in the walls. The five beggars living with him in the same house, ranging between age four to ten, all shuddered at Quide's roar.

At the innermost hole was the smallest girl. The short-haired girl bit hard on her left hand, her face turning red. She looked at Wu Qiren who was on the floor in fear. At the hole beside her was Ned, a six-year-old boy who screamed with fright.

The girl was Coria. Wu Qiren understood the reason she was afraid.

In fact, Wu Qiren's luck that week was good. He, currently known as the beggar Thales, had obtained thirty-seven coppers this week. It was eighteen coppers more than the previous week.

However, he only surrendered fourteen coppers to Quide, the head of the beggar trade in a Black Street Brotherhood. The rest of the money, along with two years of coppers that he had saved, was delivered to Grove Pharmacy. With the help of the kind-hearted worker Yanni, he bought a course of medicine for typhoid fever.

Thales fed the medicine to the four-year-old Coria. Having typhoid fever at her age would be fatal without any medicine.

Over the last five years, Thales relived his past memories from the age of two to his current age of seven. From an ignorant child, he began recalling his past life bit by bit. The memories appeared fragmented and disordered. Even then, during these five years, he began to gain more and more awareness as compared to the initial fuzzy stage. He had a profound feeling when he saw others meet their end.

There were those who died from illness, those who fell to their deaths, those who drowned, those who were hanged, and those who were beaten to death (Thales even saw a crying beggar suffocated to death by a supernatural power from ten meters away once). The human trafficking business of the Black Street Brotherhood had no bottom line or principles. Even if they were gangsters, they needed time to hammer out rules and order. It had only been ten years since they started and expanded.

Additionally, the Blood Bottle Gang, also known as the 'nobles of the gangsters', in its ninety years history, had blood debts with its enemy.

Most of the time when witnessing these deaths, Thales felt helpless. Even he himself avoided a fatal end more than once by relying on scattered memories of his previous life.

Just like his current situation.

Quide was itching for a fight and was in high spirits. The look in his eyes was so characteristic of sadistic gangsters: vicious, cruel and sadistic.

"I did not stash any money\! It is almost winter. Fewer people are passing by these three districts…” Thales got up from the ground as he quickly thought of and gave an excuse.

\*Slap\*

What greeted him was a ruthless slap in the face. Thales fell back to the ground.

"Hand over the money before I beat you up\! Or I could beat you up first until you hand over the money\! Take your pick\!"

Obviously, Quide did not want to hear his excuse. The leader of the Brotherhood probably just wanted to extort for some beer money from them. Another possibility was that he simply wanted to beat somebody up.

"You can also be stubborn. I love stubborn children the most," Quide grinned hideously as he started rubbing his fists.

Looking at the large fists in front of him, Thales knew that Quide would not let him go even if he did not say anything.

Quide had tortured a beggar from the fifth room to death the previous month.

Thales held his red and swollen face as he quickly thought to himself.

Normally, Quide did not care about the accounts. When night fell, he would proceed to the subway's Sunset Pub to hang around or drink. He would not know how many Midier coppers was one Mindis silver, let alone how much the beggars under his care had turned in. This was all done by his deputy, the steady and dependable Rick. Even the shrewd Rick knew that the beggars earned about eight coppers per person every week.

Somebody had told on them.

That was the only possibility.

Thales looked around at the group of beggars. After getting his money from a rich female noble, he had returned directly to the Abandoned Houses2. The beggars in the house must have seen this. In such a grim environment, a child's heart could become even more terrifying than what an adult could imagine.

Quide started to kick again. Thales secretly protected his abdomen with his elbow. He used some of his strength and pretended to be in unbearable pain from the kick. He could not make any sound as Quide loved the screams of children.

"I will speak\!" Thales said with a fearful expression. "Don't hit me\!"

"That depends on my mood\!" Quide looked around and saw the other five beggars cowering in fear. This made him feel satisfied as his authority was respected.

"Wednesday morning, I met a noblewoman. She gave me ten coppers." Thales spoke as he trembled and hid in a corner.

"I knew it\! Begging? It was stolen right? Nobody can hide the truth from me, especially a little thief like you\!" Quide rubbed his palms viciously as he prepared for the next round of beatings. "Take out the money\!"

Without even waiting for Quide to raise his eyebrows, Thales then added. "But I went to Red Street Market\!"

"Red Street Market?" Quide lowered his raised hand a little. "You went to the Blood Bottle Gang's territory?"

"Yes. We cannot earn much money in our place anymore." Other than those in the Brotherhood, the brilliant and brave, and those with a specific purpose, there is none that would enter the three districts near the shady street without being cautious. Even the guards from the city defense team with swords and shields were unwilling to enter such a place full of crime."

"I got so much money the first day but the Blood Bottle Gang did not appear. I thought there would be an opportunity the next day."

"Idiot\!" Quide fiercely kicked Thales. Thales saw Coria tremble at a distance. He then heard Quide shouted, "Think about it. How could the Blood Bottle's territory be such an easy pick?"

Thales recoiled back and really trembled. "Yes. The next afternoon, the Blood Bottle Gang caught me and hung me up. I said I was lost but they did not believe me. I gave them all my money and they still did not let me go."

"You good for nothing\! How did you escape?" Quide spat ruthlessly.

"After that, I said I was Boss Quide's subordinate and they laughed loudly."

"What?" Quide clenched his fist and grabbed Thales' worn-out burlap collar. He raised Thales from the corner of a wall and asked, "What were they laughing at?"

Thales shook his head and replied, "I did not understand what they said."

Quide fiercely looked at him. "Speak quickly\!"

Thales showed a terrified expression. He trembled and said, "Amongst them was a bald person. He said to 'spare the child since the child belongs to Quide and that Quide really needs children…”

Before Thales could finish, Quide had flung him against a wall.

He tried his best to protect his head and chest. He used the back of his body to endure the impact from the wall. He then immediately turned his back to Quide and withstood the blows of fury. After taking the blows for a moment, he tilted his back a little to cushion the intensity of the blows.

"Son of a… this bald… Sven… How did he know… I will kill you… Useless… Idiot\!"

Mad with rage, Quide yelled repeatedly as he continued kicking Thales, but only a few words were discernible.

The children in the other holes in the wall were horrified to see Thales beaten up. However, they tightly covered their mouths and dared not say anything.

Thales kept enduring Quide's enraged kicks that vented his anger.

At the very least, now Quide would not ask where the extra money went. Besides that, although he was terrifying, an enraged Quide was much safer than a Quide who was gleefully torturing some kids.

Thales' words were half-truths. Thales did go to the Red Street Market but he hid at the dark corners of the alleys and watched his surroundings carefully. He did encounter a noblewoman who wore clothes of goose feathers. By her side were twenty Swordsmen of Eradication. This was when he came out to beg. It was the reason the Blood Bottle Gang did not interrupt him. Thales also obtained twelve coppers from the noble. (He was not stupid enough to steal it in front of twenty Swordsmen of Eradication.) Thales did not wait for the noble to leave, he disappeared into the crowd, never returning.

As for the bald Sven, Thales had never actually met him before. He only knew that the man was the head debt collector of the Blood Bottle Gang. Quide himself was once a thug for the Brotherhood. That was until Quide provoked the wrong person and had a lower part of his body broken. This information was a secret. Thales found out about this at the Brotherhood's large house when he overheard the Assassins, Layork and Felicia, secretly laugh at Quide.

Once Quide finished venting and cursing the bald Sven, he took out a bottle of wine and left grumbling. The back of Thales' clothes had been torn. His back looked bluish purple. Because Thales avoided getting hit directly and had turned sideways, some parts of his body bled from being scratched. The pain came, throbbing in waves.

Blood flowed to the ground. Thales could feel a burning pain. Perhaps because he had not been beaten in a very long time, his muscles felt as though they were burning.

Ever since transmigrating into this world; getting beaten up, becoming hungry, falling sick and feeling cold were all common experiences. However, ever since Thales gradually recovered his memories as Wu Qiren, by staying cautious and also relying on his previous experience, he had not been viciously beaten like this for a long time.

When Quide's voice faded away, the other five children crawled out from their holes. They proficiently carried the weak Thales to the yard. The ten-year-old 'Big Boy' Sinti scooped out water from a jar with a worn-out bowl. The crippled Ryan and the black-faced Kellet were both eight years old. They struggled to gather dead branches and weeds. They then start a fire with flints. The six-year-old yellow-haired Ned and the youngest Coria gathered a few strange leaves. They chewed the leaves and then rubbed it on Thales' badly-bruised back.

Thales endured the pain as he tried to find a way to distract himself. He turned to see a crying Coria and a dejected Ned. He then tried to speak in a calm tone.

"It is alright. Ned, I do not blame you."

Ned suddenly raised his head and looked alarmed. The other four children gazed at him.

"How did you know?" Ned could not help but feel guilty and horrified.

When Thales was being beaten up by Quide, the three older children, though afraid, were gazing at the sight unwaveringly. The remaining two were Coria and Ned. One covered her face and did not dare to raise her head. The other looked at the wall and occasionally glanced in horror.

Coria's typhoid medicine was the sole purpose of those coppers. Coria would definitely not divulge that. Thales was not sure if it was Ned but now there was no doubt.

He tried to squeeze out a smile. "It is alright. Quide will not pursue this matter anymore."

"I… I…” Ned blushed in shame. He looked at Thales' back as his tears ran down. "I did not manage to obtain any money this week. I also did not dare to go and steal." He sobbed, "Rick did not say anything but Quide was very unhappy. He said if this continued, he would sell me to the desert where the Barren Bone people will eat me. I was so scared that I told him that you came back with a lot of coppers on one of the days… I thought that this way they would not… Quide then sent me back and said that he would come tonight."

Coria's face turned red too. The herbal medicine in her hands trembled and a few drops of blood dripped down to the floor from Thales' back. Thales moaned in silence. The diminishing burning sensation of pain was once again aggravated by Coria's actions.

Ryan glared angrily at Ned, causing Ned to lower his head even more. Kellet looked at Ned with a surprised expression and then looked at Thales. Only Sinti remained silent and continued to bring the water over.

This kid was only six.

Thales thought to himself.

This child was so innocent. Faced with Quide he was terrified and, in the commotion, he had uttered the wrong words.

"It is alright, Ned, Coria." Thales felt his injury getting better. He gently held Ned's hand. "But, you have seen it too, what Quide is capable of…”

Ned sobbed a little in terror.

Thales looked at him solemnly and said, "Next time, if you all cannot find enough money, just tell me. I will think of a way."

"When compared to Quide, only we are in the same group."

Ned cried uncontrollably. His words were interrupted by his sobbing. "Th-Thales. S-So-Sorry."

Thales silently watched Ned crying non-stop.

Finally, he turned his head around and inhaled lightly.

"It is alright now, Ned." Thales sighed and took the bowl of water from Sinti for a sip. "Don't worry. I will find a way."

Even then…

He looked at the other five children. Even the recovering Coria still looked terrified.

Tomorrow I must find a way to get more money. He thought to himself.

…

At the Sunset Temple of the Eternal Star City, after the prayers at sunset, a trainee priest who was cleaning the altar stopped her movements. She looked in surprise at the lamp containing Eternal Oil.

Ever since she started taking care of the altar she had never seen this lamp being used. It was a lamp that had never gained attention. That lamp suddenly lit up with a bright yellow flame.

The flames suddenly turned vigorous and red like the color of blood.

An elder priest noticed the trainee's unusual demeanor. She shouted resentfully and chided the trainee before shifting her attention to the altar. But when she noticed the unusually lit lamp, she screamed.

"Niah\! Quick\! Inform the ritual master\!"

The elder's surprise could not be concealed. She trembled and scurried over to that lamp, raised her right palm and then her left palm, as she prepared to pray.

What is going on? This was the first time the trainee Niah saw the respected priest lose her composure. It was to the extent that she herself was influenced.

Did I make a mistake? But I did not touch the lamp.

"But. But what do I tell the ritual master? Someone secretly came by and lit up the lamp by the altar?" Niah asked feeling flustered.

"No."

The elder kept staring at the lamp. Her praying hands continued changing their positions.

"This light, even if you search across the two continents of Errol and its countless islands, there is only one person who can light it up."

"That person would determine the future of this kingdom\!"

Chapter 2   
Nervous Rick

"How did he end up like this from drinking?"

In the slums of the Lower City Second District, Quide's deputy, Nayer Rick, looked at the wine bottle in front of him with disgust. Quide was so drunk that he was like a heap of mud. Rick waved his hand and had two members of the Brotherhood carry the man down.

"Lock him in a room for a day. Release him when he is sober."

For him to drink to this state would mean that he could not do much to the child. Rick gave a mysterious smile.

Nayer Rick was a person who preferred others to address him by his surname. Quide fell in ranking from the thugs' chief to the beggars' chief after some setback. In comparison to the sluggish Quide, Rick was an ambitious and capable member of the Brotherhood.

He once studied at an accounting academy at Shocker City, south of the kingdom. If it was not because his scribe father had made a mistake, Rick could be working in the department of a city or even as a treasurer of certain households. He could also go even further and become a merchant of an industry. After some time, he would buy a title and join the upper ranks of the Constellation. Three hundred years ago, a clan with the sunflower symbol, Seucader, had risen just like this and was now a prominent noble clan in the kingdom.

But even though he fell from grace and joined a gang and thus was forever severed from the path of a noble, Rick also believed that his words would have more sway compared to his colleagues whose heads were only filled with muscle and women.

When the Brotherhood expanded to the southern coasts of the kingdom, Rick who happened to pass by was recruited. He utilized his talents and successfully sold a few slaves. The higher ranked members of the Brotherhood took notice of him and promoted him. They then dispatched him to Eternal Star City, the capital of the kingdom, the heart of Constellation and the bright pearl of the western part of the continent. They allowed him to manage the Brotherhood and the accounts of the beggars.

Rick knew that although he had been sent as Quide's deputy and accountant, the beggar's business had already been entrusted to him by the Brotherhood. He looked at his 'boss' Quide who was once a well-known thug in the Third Street for being skilled at using swords and axes. Quide had now become trash that sought dignity from beggars. If Quide was not the son of a high-ranked member of the Brotherhood, he would have long been drowned and left to rot. On top of that, most of the beggar's losses were caused by Quide.

Naturally and fortunately, Quide's father had given Rick a lot of bribe money every month. This was how Rick could still profit.

With such a son, Quide's father would have immediately loss influence and power were he not an arms-dealing Powerhouse1.

What would the outcome of an underworld bigshot that lost his influence be?

Rick shook his head and watched Quide leave.

The beggar's business appeared petty and lowly, especially when compared to smuggling weapons and drugs, the trade of Eternal Oil and Crystal Drop Ores, as well as debt collection.

However, Rick believed that this was his opportunity.

The Brotherhood had grown quickly but human trafficking had always been its major source of profits. They dealt with everything including infants, elderly, humans, elves and even intelligent beings from the Magic Empress' territory. However, the most crucial thing was the origins of the Brotherhood's member. Among them, 'Widow Blackheart' Behrs was responsible for gathering and raising them. She would also sell some of them. The older ones would be sent to Rick to be tempered into beggars. When they grew up, the teenagers would be trained as thugs by 'Ironsheet' Locke and prostitutes by Felicia 'the Unfaithful'. They may also go to the other leaders and be disciplined into becoming members of the Brotherhood.

This was why Rick who ran the beggar business thought he was working at the foundation of the Brotherhood's business and the future of the Brotherhood's transportation lifeline. It was also an information network in the capital. Thinking about it, he could identify all the promising and young future prospects for the Brotherhood. He can then obtain favors for the future.

This went to show that Nayer Rick was an ambitious person.

Besides that, Rick was very excited when he thought of something. This was Eternal Star City\! It was the capital of Constellation, the second largest kingdom on the western part of the continent. It was also the birthplace of the Black Street Brotherhood. They can surely see that working here was like being a representative for the bigshots. This also meant that there would be opportunities for promotion.

Naturally, the chances for there to be a bad accident was also quite high.

'I am lucky.' Rick clasped his hands behind his back as he looked at the drunk Quide from afar with his eyebrows raised. 'I am lucky that this guy is a walking disaster.'

Under the moonlight, Rick turned and looked at the dozen or so abandoned houses. He knew that there were many beggars in each one. These seedlings were important chips for his future advancement.

One example was the black-haired Thales from the sixth house. Two years ago, the caretaker Behrs sent him here. She had displayed a different attitude towards that child.

The child who was eight years old at most was clever and crafty. He managed to act out a play and begged for money. A cute child who was beaten up by other children and had his money and food taken away. When he hid at a corner to weep alone, the ladies passing by could not help but give him compensation. Rick found that he was unlike other beggars who cried hoarsely to the extent that others felt depressed. 'We need more people who can use their brains in the Brotherhood.'

'When this child grows up, he would definitely climb higher. I should give him a reward and make him feel grateful. Naturally, without a contrast between the rewards, people will not feel grateful.'

This was also why when the boy from Thales' house claimed that Thales was secretly in possession of some money, Rick urged Quide to investigate the reason. When Thales was almost beaten to death by Quide, Rick would appear and stop him. He was even willing to antagonize Quide if necessary (that was all Quide was good for). Thales would then treat Rick as a patron.

Rick did not care about whether all the money the beggars earned was handed over. This was what only short-sighted people would care about. Compared to a few coppers, Rick understood that human relationship was a more important property.

But this Thales was too clever. Rick knew that Quide would torture Thales to death regardless of whether he possessed the money (which would only be worse if he did have money). However, the boy found a way to escape disaster. According to common understanding, the spirited Quide would 'meticulously' punish the disobedient children to foster talent regardless of whether they were actually disobedient.

'It does not matter. What must be done had to be done. If the effect was not good and it failed, a reason could be found for Quide to beat him up.'

Rick went to the sixth house and walked across the ruined door. He then saw weeds at the yard and Thales gasping for breath as he lied down on the ground. Next to him were a few children smearing something onto him. My God\! Children under the age of ten knew how to grow and use Urth Dragon Leaves? Only experienced gang members and the poor that lived for a very long time possessed the know-how to use this herb as a cheap cure for injuries.

"Ah\! Mister Rick\!" The crippled Ryan noticed Rick's arrival. His experience of having one leg broken had made him more sensitive to the surrounding environment.

It had been less than an hour after Quide was gone, the fear in the yard had yet to have subsided. The informant, Ned's face was covered in tears. Kellet was covering her black face. The eldest, Sinti, flinched.

The youngest, Coria, even screamed from fear.

Behrs had once said that this person had a noble inheritance and was most likely a beautiful woman in the future. She must not be ruined. Profits would come after she was trained by Felicia. It was a pity that the beggars must be handed over at the age of ten, or at latest at the age of twelve. It would be great if I could keep her until fifteen. Thirteen would be fine as well.

"Mister Rick\!" Thales interrupted Rick's subtle thoughts. He turned his head with difficulty. The injury on his back caused him to grimace in pain.

"Ah. Thales. I am sorry," Rick sighed and showed a compassionate expression. "I could not stop Quide. I am only his deputy. I also cannot offend his backer."

"I could only come here quietly after that." While being cautiously watched by the other children, Rick squatted down and carefully examined Thales' injuries. "Fortunately, he was not so rough today. Otherwise…”

"Mister Rick. I am fine." Thales struggled genuinely. "I am sorry. The money I earned last week was actually…”

"Forget about the money\!" Rick took the worn-out bowl from Sinti's hands. He threw away the water and placed a few Urth Dragon Leaves in it. He then picked up a stone and started to grind it. "You were sent here the moment you began to be aware of your surroundings. These few years, I watched all of you grow from a mere child trembling from the cold into a rough and thick-haired child. For me, all of you are more important than a few coppers," Rick said with a pained expression. "At this age, all of you are not even supposed to be begging but these are the rules of the Brotherhood."

"Mister Rick." Thales looked as though he felt touched by Rick's sentiments. He then tightened his fists. "I…”

"Come. Use the stones to grind the leaves. It is better than chewing it." Rick smeared the contents onto his hand and then smeared it on Thales' back. Next to him, Kellet bit her lip and whimpered.

"Thank you, Mister Rick," said Coria in a soft tone. "It would be great if you were in charge of us instead of Quide."

"Don't let Quide hear this." Rick laughed helplessly. "To be honest, I am very afraid of him."

The other children also laughed. Rick knew that people would accept another person easily when a common ground and a sense of humor was shown.

"Thank you very much, Mister Rick." Thales earnestly said. He knew that he was very mature in the eyes of many and did not need to show a child-like side.

Rick nodded. "Protect yourself well. You are a smart kid. I believe you can do it\!"

"Oh right." Rick seemed to suddenly remember something. He returned the bowl to Ned and took out a purse from his waist. He then handed it over to the bewildered Sinti. "I need to hand over money to the higher ups every month and do not have much. Here are thirty coppers. Go to Grove Pharmacy at the intersection between Twilight District and the Lower City District and buy some medicine. If the price of the medicine has not yet increased, the amount of money here should be enough."

Naturally, the money would not be enough. Rick thought to himself. He had been to the pharmacy a week ago and the price had just hiked. When the children discover that the money was not enough, they would think it was caused by a temporary price hike.

If they did not have enough money, they would need to beg for more. This way, they would not have enough for next week's quota. After that…

"Be careful when you leave to buy the medicine. Do not let others, especially Quide, find out." Rick said as he stood up.

Of course, Quide would find out. Rick thought.

If they do not buy the medicine, that would be even better. Quide would find out that they were hiding money.

The corners of Rick's mouth raised.

At that moment, I can obtain all of their loyalty.

"Mister Rick." Coria looked at the purse in Sinti's hand as tears were about to fall from her eyes. "You are really a good person."

Ned bit his lips and nodded.

Even the eldest, Sinti, was touched and weighed the purse in his hands.

Rick sighed and waved his hand. "No. I am the one that should apologize. I could only do this for you."

"Mister Rick," Thales was lying down on the ground and hesitantly looked at Rick. "I wonder…”

"Eh?" Rick raised his eyebrows. "What's wrong?"

"I heard that when we grow up, we would be sent elsewhere to be trained." Thales asked cautiously as though not wanting to offend Rick. "In that case, I wonder if we could work for you once our training is complete."

Hearing this, Kellet, Ned, and Coria looked at Rick expectantly.

Rick felt as though his heart grew.

Score. Faster than I expected.

"Haha. This?" Rick gave a smile. "Don't look at me like this now. I am an ideal man in the Brotherhood."

Rick smiled and bent down to touch Thales' hair, appearing more intimate. "The people under me are the best and the strongest in the Brotherhood\!"

'This is just my truth.' Rick added in his heart.

"That is why, if you all want to work for me, you must work hard\!"

"Mm\!" The children nodded with hope. Thales was no exception.

"I am going now. Thales and the rest of you…” Rick turned his head around, showing the side of his face. "The next time this happens, secretly come over and inform me. Although I cannot stop him directly, I could look for some trouble and prevent him from approaching."

After Rick was finished, he showed his white teeth that gleamed under the moonlight and left without looking back.

"Mister Rick is such a good person." Ned's face was in a mess from the tears. "Not like that Quide."

"Mm." Coria nodded and seemed content as though she was eating sweets.

"But," The crippled and fearful Ryan hesitantly said, "I've always felt that Rick is more terrifying than Quide."

"So, you are a coward\!"

"Ryan the coward. How are you going to earn money like this?"

Only Thales looked calm after Rick left.

When he saw Sinti counting the thirty coppers in the purse one by one, Thales breathed out a sigh.

He still felt pain on his back. He knew that medicine would be good for his injury. However, Thales had gone to Grove Pharmacy yesterday morning. When he took the typhoid medicine from Yanni, he had heard her complain about her stingy boss raising the price. The price of medicine for injuries had gone up to thirty-five coppers. It was five coppers more than the amount Rick had given them.

However, he also knew the daughter of the boss of the Sunset Pub. That was how he knew an important point. Rick was in charge of all of Quide's expenses at the pub.

But…

"I would also need to hand over the money to the higher ups every month and do not have much."

Rick's voice resounded in his ears and he could no longer bear to look at the purse filled with coppers.

The other beggars had already forgotten their fears and started being noisy.

Only Thales frowned. With difficulty, he turned to look at his own bruised back. He then sighed heavily.

This damn world.

…

Rick went to the tenth house. There was an eight-year-old named Kalak who was young but ruthless. Rick pressured Karak into joining him when he suddenly felt his neck turn cold.

This was his innate ability.

When he was absolutely calm (a little distraction would cause it to fail), his neck would feel cold when there was a living thing five meters near him.

That was all.

However, he was not a warrior. Even if he was a warrior, his ability was useless compared to those in the military with psionic abilities, the powerful Swordsmen and Knights of Eradication, and even those mysterious Mystics. Even trainees in the temple could push him down.

However, Rick felt that one day, this skill would save his life.

Just like this very moment.

Rick quickly turned and looked around under the moonlight. At the same time, he put his left hand into his pocket and took out a compact but deadly crossbow.

The moonlight was bright. The streets were empty and there was nowhere to hide. Yet, there was nothing.

Rick took a deep breath and kept himself absolutely calm. He could feel the cool feeling behind his neck persist.

'Was it a rat in the sewers?'

Rick ran quickly to three different locations and the feeling remained. This made him reject his assumption.

What kind of rat would follow me for twenty meters after running towards three different directions?

Rick started to become more frightened.

Rick believed he should not have ventured out alone even though he was merely visiting the Abandoned Houses in the Brotherhood's territory.

He should have brought along twenty guards, with each of them wielding a Mystic Gun in each hand.

Just like the bigshot of the drug business Lazans Fischer, he always brought thirty people with him whenever he went out.

If I had enough money, I should have hired two Swordsmen of Eradication or a Psionic Warrior. Maybe even a Mystic. Forget it, Mystics were too scary.

Nayer Rick. You must be calm. He told himself. In the future, you would be in charge of Eternal Star City. Even the underground people of Constellation were calm. You must stay calm.

Rick turned around and calmly backtracked as though he was jogging.

'Did I offend someone? Does someone want my life? Was there something interesting in this neighborhood?'

He jogged away for hundreds of meters under the moonlight. There was nobody around him, yet his neck still felt cold.

Chapter 3   
Ghost

"Pardon my coming here presumptuously. But if the news from the Sunset Temple… If the information is reliable…” The right hand of the grey-haired middle-aged noble trembled slightly. He held his left chest and bowed deeply.

"Please allow me to personally settle this matter for you."

"You are quite well informed, old friend."

"It is not yet confirmed but that Lamp in the Sunset Temple has lit. Looks like it is quite close by."

Beside the blazing fire, a robust figure lowered his right hand near his chin and somberly said, "I have already dispatched Yodel. He is better than Aida at being inconspicuous"

"You know how important this information is. Even Liscia immediately sealed off the altar in the name of the oracle. That is why I cannot risk unnecessary exposure. I would only dispatch you in secret after there is absolute confirmation."

"Of course, of course." The gray-haired middle-aged noble concealed his excitement with difficulty. "If that time comes, I will wholeheartedly serve you."

The robust figure sighed. "I should be more excited than you when I heard this news.

"But I don't know why. I am feeling very calm."

…

Rick did not know how he ended up returning to the headquarters of the Brotherhood.

The cold feeling at his neck was still there.

When he saw the Black Street headquarters, the two elite guards were playing knife games at the entrance. When he reached just outside the building, some shadowy figures were on guard, keeping watch. He entered the building and saw Powerhouse Morris behind the large iron table, examining the account books, and Felicia who had a disgusted expression (her proposal to raise the expenses of the brothel was rejected). He finally felt relieved. Even the Assassin Layork who had always been on bad terms with him seemed amiable sitting at the dining table in the candlelight.

Without noticing, the cold feeling at his neck disappeared as though it was never there.

Even Rick wondered if he had been too nervous.

He talked to Morris who was in charge of human trafficking that he suspected someone had been following him. Layork laughed and spat out a mouthful of wine. It extinguished the flames from the candle on the table. Felicia gave a huge yawn and tightened her large bosom. The look in her eyes became even more despicable.

Morris noticed Rick's cold sweat and weird look. He then patted Rick's shoulder. He told Rick not to overwork and watch less of Dark Night Temple's dramas. Rick was also told to wait for Doctor Ramon to give him some calming prescriptions when he returned from his call.

'Shit\!'

Rick knew it was difficult for others to believe in his special ability, let alone an Assassin who had followed him from the Abandoned Houses to Black Street. This person had followed him for an entire kilometer and remained unseen as well as not taking any action. However, Rick subconsciously believed that this person was real.

After he returned to his room and lay down, he recalled the events in the tailing encounter that night. Even though he was usually very paranoid he could not help but think to himself: 'Was I really too nervous?'

Rick calmed down again and tried to use his ability again. Everything was fine. The back of his neck felt comfortable.

'Alright. I was probably paranoid.'

But suddenly, the hair-raising chill in the neck struck again\!

'F\*ck\!'

'I can't sleep anymore\!'

Rick suddenly jumped out of bed.

He pulled out a box from under the bed. Inside the box was a Siegel 6 Mystic Gun that needed to be carried with both hands. Feeling nervous, he stuck to the walls and carefully walked out to the hallway and listened carefully.

The hallway was full of lamps using Eternal Oil that would never extinguish. The hallway was very brightly lit but there was still nobody around. At a distance, a sentry on duty just came out of the toilet and was walking back. As though scratching at an itch, he pulled the crotch of his leather armor as he walked past Rick.

At the end of the hallways, Layork and Felicia shouted their licentious cries as usual.

"Damn. May this shameless couple break his penis after using too much force." Rick cursed loudly.

The Brotherhood member from earlier had the same feeling. He turned around and nodded to Rick. Their eyes locked as a sense of understanding appeared between the two.

Rick then saw the member scratch the crotch of his armor painfully. Meanwhile, the other party looked at him trying very hard to carry the Mystic Gun and leaning against the wall.

Both of them turned around awkwardly and went back to their original locations.

Rick rubbed the back of his neck.

'Shit. This ability must not be working properly.'

If a skilled elite of the enemy could sneak into the Brotherhood HQ undetected, holding the Mystic Gun would be pointless. Powerhouse Morris' ability would also be useless.

'Time to sleep\!'

…

Thales' back injuries looked bad but it was not serious. This was because he was able to stand and walk again by the third day.

Yes, a famous person's attributes would be heavenly gifted. While lining up, Thales sighed as he looked at the Abandoned Houses with broken walls. He then received the rye bread and wild herbs from the thug Pierson and started to eat it.

He had unfortunately been born in such a place.

"By your side is a sharp branch. You must be the one who cut my hand\!"

"It is not me\! My hand was also hurt last night\!"

"All of us had our hands hurt\! It must be the people from the eighth house\! They envy our gains from yesterday."

"So, it was them\! We from the fourteenth house were also injured at night\! They do not want us to go out and pickpocket\!"

Thales yawned as he lazily listened to the beggars from the other houses. The argument developed into a fight. Beside these beggars was a crowd cheering. This happened until the thugs stopped them. Thales sighed as he swallowed the last mouthful of the awful food, then clapped his hands as he called out to the beggars from the sixth house.

"Time to work."

That day was Tuesday. The sixth house's begging went smoothly. For more business, they went near the sentry post, which was located at Western City Gate.

The recent week seemed to be the celebration of the Sunset God. However, there was a rumor that there was an oracle command to seal off the altar. This led to many believers entering the city from the west that week. They climbed the city walls and prayed to the setting sun as atonement for not being able to pray to the Sunset Goddess' local representative.

Before the guards' angry glares graduated to physical obstacles, Thales had successfully stolen a Luminous Moon deity statue made of black wood from a street vendor with the help of Coria and Ryan. The street vendor had paid too much attention to his wallet ("Go away bastards\!"). So, when Ryan and Coria were busy haggling with him for some stuff, Thales stretched out his hand and took the package behind him.

The market price of the Luminous Moon deity statue was at least fifty coppers. Naturally, the statue should not see the light of day and could only be sold through the Brotherhood channel. The veterans in the Brotherhood would know that they were just beggars and thieves. They would then push down the buying price, and if it were anything valuable they would even fight over it. Earning five coppers from it was already good.

However, the smallest mosquitos were still food even though tiny.

When Thales and the others returned to the Abandoned Houses, they saw Rick patrol the place. But he was not the usual calm and amiable self. Instead, he hurriedly admonished the guards with a few words and then disappeared.

"Is Mister Rick in trouble?" The hungry Coria bit her fingers, her stomach rumbling away. They had gone far and returned home late. Fortunately, Thales had quite a good relationship with the thug distributing the meals, Pierson. He often bribed him a little and then the other side would agree to keep some rice for them.

"It is probably Quide. That guy really knows how to create problems." Kellet replied. His stomach also cried out.

Hearing this name, Ryan and Ned trembled.

"Kids. There is no more food tonight." When the six entered, they could not see a soul in the dining yard. In the distance, Pierson who was in charge of getting food for them, waved his hand.

"Don't look at me. I also can't do anything about it." Pierson shook his head when faced with six angry children with no energy to ask questions and ignored them. "Rick had ordered us to rest earlier and moved our schedules ahead."

Thales frowned and touched his empty belly. He started thinking about whether to sneak into the thug's sentry posts and steal some food at night.

He then looked at the other five anxiously waiting for food and sighed. He took out the Luminous Moon statue from his pocket.

Finally, with Thales' persuasion, the Luminous Moon statue was used to trade with Pierson for the food he had initially prepared for himself: two strips of dog meat, four halves of rye bread and half a bowl of black pine vegetable.

"Recently, Rick and Quide are rather edgy." While the other children ate, Pierson told Thales a piece of information before he left. "Quide's temper is getting worse by the day. He kept cursing some 'damn baldy' all day but he had always been like that. However, Rick has become weird especially in the last two days. According to those in the headquarters…”

At this moment, Pierson looked around and then whispered to Thales. “…he got tangled up with a ghost."

Thales watched Pierson leave as he bit into the unpalatable rye bread. However, when one is hungry, the rye bread would be particularly delicious.

Thales silently pondered. 'I wonder what happened to Rick to end up running into a ghost.'

'As for what made Quide in a bad mood… ' Thales swallowed the bread. 'Looks like I need to keep a low profile for now.'

…

Rick became nervous again. Two days ago, he had thought that his special ability made a mistake.

That was until this morning when he opened up the register to prepare for the beggar's supplies. At that time, he had confirmed that his special ability did not make a mistake.

Rick was an ambitious person. He had believed that to achieve his ambition, he needed to start working on the small details, like the daily habits One example was that he would never write his plans and travel itinerary on paper. Another example was that hairs would be placed at inconspicuous places at all the drawers and containers keeping the important documents in case someone sneaked a look at them. He also did not keep all of his money in one place. He was proud of his own cautiousness and believed that he would be rewarded one day for it.

Like now.

When Rick opened the roster of beggars, there was a hair on each page in the same position.

This should have been a good thing. It would mean that nobody had flipped the pages. However, Rick was the son of a scribe.

His father had taught him that if a person wants it done, it was possible for a good thief or ranger to avoid the hair trick. They can open up the documents they want with the utmost secrecy.

And so, Rick learned a more cautious approach from his father.

The way to read the pages in secret would obviously be to put the hair strands back in their original position after flipping the pages.

The fastest way would be to hold the hair in place, turn the pages, then use the hand to hold the top and bottom layer of the page to keep the hair in place.

How would one counter this method?

For nobles, the fastest and safest would be to use a wax seal.

However, Rick's father had a special method. They used fry oil1 to create a sticky gel. This oil was used by the poor living near the river bank. One characteristic and also the weakness of this gel was that it was not very sticky. As long as the book was not too heavy, even if the book is closed after being coated, the glued area would not stick. An external force was needed to hold both sides for some time before the page would stick.

When Rick opened the roster, he found the hair at the same place except for something different. The hair was stuck to the page.

Someone had been reading his list of beggars. That person held this hair as that person flipped the pages.

Rick felt his heart turn cold.

'On top of that, to have all four hairs at inconspicuous positions at their original positions without leaving any traces show that this person is a master.'

'Fortunately, this secret technique that was passed down by my father enabled me to notice this.'

'Four days ago, after watching Thales' begging act, I looked through the roster to find out which house he lived in. At that time, everything was normal.'

'From then until now. In these four days, somebody had come into my room and looked at the roster of beggars?'

Rick's scalp felt cold. He suddenly realized that this was not the most important thing.

He frantically opened the secret compartment of the drawers and checked the most important document, the trafficking books and the passbook of his secret deposits at Princely Bank.

His books and passbook were all safe. There were no signs of them being flipped and the hairs also fell naturally.

Rick felt relieved.

'Fortunately, the things in the secret compartment are still… wait. If it was a master. How did he miss the secret compartment?'

He took out the entire secret compartment and took it apart. He then placed his hand on the top of one part of the secret compartment to look for the hair that was stuck there.

After that, he collapsed back in his chair.

The hair was still stuck to a seam of the secret compartment.

When Rick was still scared out of his wits, he entered the dining hall. He turned a blind eye to the flirting Layork and Felicia. However, the always objectionable Layork loved gloating over other's misfortune. He shouted out to Rick.

"Accountant. I heard you met a ghost?"

Rick ignored him and sat down but continued to look expressionless. He pulled over a bottle of ink used for bookkeeping and treated it as sauce as he poured it over his beefsteak.

"Don't mind him." Felicia smiled as she sat in Layork's arms. She glanced amorously at the Assassin with her lips pursed and fed red wine to him. "Do you still want to come to my room tonight?"

"Of course. Of course," Layork hurriedly replied without waiting to swallow the wine, "I just learned today that the boss had removed the sentries outside the rooms a week ago. So, tonight we can… hahaha… we can be even wilder."

"Aiyo. You are really naughty."

\*Clang\*

Rick's ink bottle fell and spilled ink onto the table. The ink flowed to the front of the couple.

He had a pale expression as he raised his head to see the displeased Layork and Felicia.

"A week ago, there were no sentries at the houses at the headquarters?"

"Nonsense\!" Layork wiped away the ink smeared on his body. In a bad mood, he threw a bread at Rick's face. "Recently, there is a lot of activity at the Blood Bottle Gang. The boss said he wants to keep this confidential and the fewer people around the better. That is why the sentry posts were moved outside the house. They are not even allowed to go into the house to use the toilet. However, you do not have to worry. Don't you have an inseparable ghost protecting you?"

"Then, in that hallway…” Rick did not realize that his voice started to tremble. "There should be no sentries at that passageway?"

Layork and Felicia had already started kissing each other as though there was nobody else around.

Rick took a deep breath.

'The day before yesterday, I was followed for some unknown reason at the Abandoned Houses. Then that night there was a non-existent sentry in the walkway. Lastly, someone looked at the beggar's roster in the room.'

'Wonderful. Everything is starting to connect.'

Nayer Rick then nervously told himself.

'You are being watched.'

'Your opponent could be very powerful. Powerful enough to move freely in the heavily guarded headquarters in Black Street. Not even a terrible Assassin like Layork or an experienced warrior like the boss, Morris, noticed'.

'I was lucky to receive my late father's blessings and noticed this.'

'He could be right behind me\!'

'I must save myself\!'

'I need to find his motive\! '

Rick's mind ran wildly.

'In the past two days, that guy must have already turned my room upside down. However, he had only had a good look at the beggar's roster. My more important account book was discarded as though it was a worn-out shoe. '

'That guy is looking for something in the beggar's roster. That's right. When I was being followed, I was at the Abandoned Houses. Those were the beggar's residences\!

'He is looking for a beggar\!'

However, Rick had a headache thinking. He had more than a hundred beggars under him. The next month, Behrs would send another group of children of unknown origins. (The important and valuable children such as the descendants of some of the elites or children of the wealthy were either already ransomed or killed.) Which beggar was the guy looking for?

'With such terrifying skill and strength, why did he not just demand openly from the Brotherhood? We would just give him to you\!'

'I would rather be in a harmonious relationship with him. I might as well drag out all the beggars and strip them naked to do a body search. Or maybe I would kill them all. This would be better than being scared out of his wits having a 'ghost' hanging around.'

'Wait. I just noticed something.'

'Why did he not make a request to the Brotherhood?'

'Naturally, this is because it is something nobody should know, even if it was the Black Street Brotherhood.'

'Are they the Brotherhood's competitors? That is wrong. If the Blood Bottle Gang had such strength, the Black Street Brotherhood would have already been destroyed dozens of times.'

'That means he does not have any formal channel and also felt that dealing with the Brotherhood of the Lower City District was not worth the time.'

'Naturally, such terrifying people would not have any dealing with gangs from the slums.'

'Why is he interested in these long-lost orphans?'

'If he is looking for missing children then why doesn't he just go directly to the police? Such people would be very influential. The authorities wouldn't dare to ignore him. Even the Brotherhood could only comply.'

'Wait\!' Rick then seemingly noticed an important point.

'Powerful, sneaky, secretive, interested in the origins of a child and does not want to deal with the Brotherhood.'

'Strength requires money and resources. He is secretive because it would be bad for him if this is made public. He does not deal with the Brotherhood because he is too highly ranked. As for being interested in the children that the Brotherhood had gathered from different sources and channels… '

'Wait.'

'Since his strength is probably above supreme-class, he must be backed by power, wealth and position. Yet he avoided the Brotherhood and the police to secretly search for a certain important child… a child?'

Rick fiercely slapped his thigh as he an idea.

'This guy is involved in the blood inheritance struggle of a big family\!'

'F\*ck\!'

Rick glared hard opposite him, at Layork and Felicia who were starting to neck.

However, his thoughts had long separated from this couple.

Perhaps in the entire Constellation, none of the fifteen million people would know of this day. A secret truth that would shake the kingdom and the continent was almost discovered by an insignificant gang leader.

Chapter 4   
Disaster Strikes Unexpectedly

"Jala\! Bring another dozen glasses of black pine wine\!"

Inside the noisy and dim Sunset Pub, Quide was breathing heavily as he leaned down on the bar counter. He raised a glass of wine to his mouth, drinking glass after glass.

"Hey, big guy. If you don't tip there would be no black pine wine\!"

Jala stood behind the bar counter and was in a bad mood as she brought two glasses of black pine wine. She slammed them on the bar counter without a trace of politeness. "I am giving you the last two glasses out of respect for your father\! I will give you thirty seconds to finish drinking it. After that, quickly get lost\! Every time you sit here for more than an hour, the profits of my bar, no, the entire Underground Street would drop by ten percent\!"

Quide was already in a daze. Even in the din of the bar, Jala's voice still sounded distant. The feeling of being stared at and the possible mockery in their hearts set Quide's heart aflame.

'In those years, I was a terrifying presence in the Lower District, the "Blood Axe" Quide. If it was not because of that incident… Now, why is it that a bar girl even dares to bully me? Even the bald-headed Sven who debuted two years later than I dared to ridicule me in front of the beggar children. They laughed at my lower body that… '

'F\*ck\!'

"Watch where you are going, girl\!" Quide gnashed his teeth. He shook his heavy head as he stood and grabbed Jala's hand. He pulled her across the bar counter and fiercely roared, "I said, another dozen glasses of black pine wine\!"

The whole pub turned quiet.

The Lower District was well known for its chaos in Eternal Star City. Moreover, the Underground Street was famous for its chaos in the Lower District. This was especially so after the Black Street Brotherhood took over ten years ago. This chaotic place revolved around the Sunset Pub. In the Sunset Pub, if a person was not a member of the Brotherhood, he would be here looking for the Brotherhood members.

This was why when Quide grabbed Jala's hand, all the other people in the pub just watched the scene. They did not say anything nor did they try and stop it.

Quide felt more and more dizzy. However, he still felt that the wrist he seized felt slippery and soft. He could smell the fragrance of Jala's body. In the dim light from the candles, the nearby Jala's brown hair appeared tidy and clean. Her smooth face and delicate figure appeared clearer than usual, causing Quide's imagination to run wild.

Jala was frightened. She was shocked by this once powerful thug who was now a drunkard.

The noise from the guests had vanished making the drunk Quide feeling pleased. He felt that his actions had received the proper attention.

But soon, when he looked at Jala's body, he started to get sober. His recklessness to be pleased gradually turned into fear.

Jala Charleton. Quide was one of the few who knew her full name.

'This pretty woman… ' Quide suddenly remembered that his father warned him to 'stay away from her' many times.

The captivating and daring 'bar girl' was gazing fixedly at him. Quide's lower jaw began to tremble.

"Jala… I did not…”

Before Quide could react, the hand that seized Jala's wrist was, in turn, pulled and locked at the back. The next second, Quide's middle finger and forefinger were bent towards the wrong direction. What followed was a heart wrenching severe pain.

"Argh\!"

Quide shouted in pain. Even his face twisted in a grimace.

However, it was not over. She had ruthlessly hooked his hand and then forcefully pulled his elbow joint the other way.

\*Crack\*

"Argh\! No\! Jala\! Big Sister Jala\! I was wrong… I should not have… argh\!"

Quide's scream coincided with the sound of his elbow being dislocated.

Before Quide's cry for mercy had ended, the nimble woman had already taken advantage of the momentum to flip over. In her extremely short pants, she had already lifted her slender left leg over the bar counter and smashed it onto Quide's neck.

"Good job Little Jala\! You did not make the boss lose face\!"

"With this skill, you can apply for the Eradicator swordsmanship training\!"

"She is actually wearing safety pants\!"

"I swear I saw it\! I dare to bet ten coppers that she is wearing black\!"

The surrounding guests resumed the partying spirit. All of them cheered for Jala.

"Listen here you big-headed gorilla\!"

Jala ruthlessly glared at Quide who was gasping for breath. She stood with one foot behind the counter and her left feet on the countertop while her right arm locked Quide's extended arm. Jala's figure was graceful and slender.

She slowly pulled out a weird knife from the holster on her left leg. The blade and the handle of the knife were not in a straight line. From a distance, it looked like the leg of a wolf.

After that, Jala stabbed the palm of Quide's hand without batting an eyelid. The Wolf Limb Blade nailed him to the bar.

The cheers of the other guests became even louder.

"Wu wu\!" Quide's tears streamed down from the pain. However, with his neck being squeezed, his cries sounded like a pig's.

Jala slowly lowered her upper body. Her gentle beauty was evident. She approached Quide's teary face before whistling and laughing.

With a look that was as fierce as a ruthless demon, but an amorous and rhythmic (causing others to feel disappointed) voice, she spoke.

"Quide Roda…”

"I don't care whose son you are. I don't care that you are the head of the beggars. I don't care that you are a thug collecting debts. However, you better f\*cking listen up\! From now onwards, if you dare to appear in my pub, I will mince your genitalia into minced meat, blend it into wine, and make you drink it\! Do you understand me?"

Quide cried as he held his pierced right hand and ran out of the pub. Meanwhile, the other guests laughed loudly while Jala continued to project a despicable look. Jala clapped her hands before she wiped the Wolf Limb Blade clean with a look of disgust as though it was not blood but the mucus of a devil.

Jala turned around unhappily and looked at the other guests who were still looking. Most of them had lascivious looks and ulterior motives.

"What are you looking at? Whoever dares to keep looking will be charged double\!"

Her rude words caused the others' attention to go back to their wine. Jala then ruthlessly threw away the rag and returned to the kitchen.

"Is that enough? I did as you said and even said the word 'genitalia'."

Jala grabbed a bottle of white wine. A multipurpose pocket knife appeared in her hand which she used to neatly open the cork.

"Of course, Miss Jala." In the kitchen, Quide's deputy and the actual manager of the beggar's business, Nayer Rick, gently lifted his black hat and nodded with a smile. "I hope he would restrain himself in future by not drinking too much and continue to wantonly tyrannize the beggars. The Brotherhood cannot always clean up his mess."

"I am sure you mean that you cannot always clean up his mess." Jala quickly drank a mouthful of wine. Rick suddenly felt that Jala's rough actions appeared appropriate, fresh and attractive.

"That is also correct. This is because the Brotherhood's gains are my gains." Rick laughed and subconsciously touched his neck.

"Do you think this would be effective? I feel like such a person would end up causing more problems such as venting on your beggars."

"You know him well," Rick thought to himself.

"Actually, I myself am not too sure if it would be useful. This is because I do not know him that well. However…” Rick shook his head helplessly. This was his signature expression of innocence. "He was aggravated three days ago for a laughable reason. He beat up one of the young ones with good prospects. If the child was not clever, another good prospect would have been killed by Quide."

"I never knew you were so kind and righteous," Jala sarcastically said in her heart.

At this point, Rick's eyes became firm.

"That is why I decided that this cannot continue. He has to be admonished otherwise sooner or later he would destroy the business containing all my hardships."

"Alright. You do not have to explain to me the reasons you want to kill your boss."

"I never said I wanted to kill him."

"Returning to the main topic, give me my agreed remuneration. I only take cash," Jala interrupted Rick. She lazily drank the white wine. She then stretched out her tongue and tried to lick the last drop of wine from the bottle. It was an action that stirred Rick's mind.

"Also, you must pay the money he owed today."

"Especially…” Jala narrowed her eyes at Rick who had taken off his hat and saluted and left.

'Don't think I do not know that you substituted Quide's wine.'

'Others may not notice but I, Jala, from the Sunset Pub can tell that Quide drank the powerful and highly concentrated Chaca wine.'

'Unlike the other wine, Chaca is often given to the death convicts in handcuffs in the western battlefield for that last charge. Drunk people have no trouble moving but they are just not as aware.'

'That is why Rick, did you think you have too much money or did you really want him dead?'

…

Quide was still tipsy and in utter humiliation and pain when he returned to the entrance of the Abandoned Houses. He did not stay at the Blackstreet Headquarters where Quide felt that everybody who knew the news would be looking at his lower body. Sure enough, two thugs happened to pass by behind the walls. The contents of their chat drifted from afar.

"Have you heard? The beggars were passing rumors that Quide is no longer a man."

"What does that mean? How could he become a woman?"

"Idiot. It means that Quide got castrated\! I heard that a few years ago, he collected debts at a haunted house at Carima Street. It was where Earl Norfolk and his family were hanged. Apparently, he encountered a red-clothed female ghost that cut off his lower body part… a clean cut."

Suddenly, Quide felt as though all the blood in his body rose to his head.

The next moment, he lost control of himself and roared as he rushed out from behind the wall. He then strangled the throat of one of the thugs tightly.

"Who?\! Who said that? Which bastard\!'

"Which bastard?"

"I am going to kill him\!"

The other thug stumbled back from fright.

Quide overpowered the thug on the ground. His grip gradually tightened. However, his impaled palm was unable to apply much strength.

Back in the day, Quide was a well-known head of the thugs in the Brotherhood and also a leader. He was dispirited in the past few years and this caused his stamina and skill to drop. As long as it was not the woman from the Charleton Family, he would still be able to overcome the other common thugs, especially in this given scenario. At that moment, Quide's anger had become a source of endless strength.

"Boss Quide. These are only rumors. We do not believe… Argh\!"

Quide suddenly raised his head like a beast.

The thug offering an excuse stepped back in extreme fear.

He could immediately see that his companion had turned pale. The companion's breath became weaker and weaker.

The thug that kept retreating saw the ominous glint from Quide's face and became frightened. "Ah, that's right. These rumors all came from the beggars. Boss, it is not our fault\! Go and ask the beggars\!"

\*Crack\*

It was the sound of a neck being broken. The thug that was being strangled by Quide was now lifeless.

Quide slowly got up from the ground with an ominous glint in his eyes. The strong aftereffects of the wine he drank had caused him to gradually lose his reasoning.

The remaining thug trembled as he looked at the terrible situation. He cried out in distress as he frantically tried to escape.

Quide wanted to chase but he was so drunk and unsteady that he was unable to run.

Quide ruthlessly gasped for breath as he looked at the corpse by his feet. He was still not satisfied so he kicked the corpse a few times. Then he shook his head and walked towards the dozen abandoned houses.

Quide never wondered why the thugs on patrol never showed up as it was necessary to keep a tight watch over the beggars. His only drive was to find the ones that ridiculed him and then torture them to death one by one.

As he had just killed someone, Quide felt as though a shackle in his mind had been released after a long time. He had returned to the days in the past where he made a living with the knife.

"These damned thieves," He fiercely thought to himself. "Since you dare to start such rumors, you better be ready to pay the price."

"Damned thieves."

The fleeing thug scaled the large gate of the Abandoned Houses. He coincidentally met Rick at the tree outside the gate.

"Mister Rick\!" The thug looked at Rick as though he had found his savior. "Boss Quide… Boss Quide has gone mad\! Didn't you say that we would be able escape in time? In the end, before we could finish speaking, Quide…” The thug was so terrified that he was breathless and his words were not clear.

"Pierson could not escape? He was killed?" Rick was taken aback.

After the thug sobbed and confirmed it, Rick shook his head sadly. "This is my fault. I had thought that after hearing this news, Quide would have… No other choice. Go and close the large gate. Lock Quide inside the Abandoned Houses District. After that, prepare the carriage. We are leaving immediately."

"Alright, Mister Rick. Where are we going?" The badly shaken thug quickly nodded repeatedly when he heard that they would leave. He did not stop to think about what would happen to the beggars who would also be locked in.

"Go to our headquarters. Look for Boss Morris."

Rick watched the thug run to the stone gates. He closed the gates and then locked it. After that, Rick's expression looked solemn.

"This time, Quide would look for all the beggars. Amongst them is definitely the one that the 'ghost' is looking for. I had moved the schedule ahead today. It is not dark yet. Quide would have most of the night to deal with the beggars.

"Whether they would be killed or tyrannized, these would be the problems of the ghost or assassin. Since he is interested in the beggars, what would he do when the beggars suffer a catastrophe?

"First of all, he would have no time to look for me. If he is here to look for the beggars, Quide would be killed by him. The Brotherhood would then take over this place tomorrow and I would not have any more problems.

"If he is here to kill a certain beggar, he may see Quide (this is very likely and nobles should never be underestimated) and allow him to continue killing the beggar. Once the objective is achieved, the problem would also be solved.'

"In other words, the family problem of this big shot and my cold neck would be solved tonight.

"If it doesn't, the ghost that is unable to find its objective would look for me." muttered Rick. Rick did not think that the lackeys of a big family would have a good temper. He also did not believe that he would live to see the next day after meeting them.

Rick had also thought of feigning illness for a month or even transferring to some other place. He had wanted to run as far as possible, away from this place, until the ghost found what it wanted.

However, if he were to suddenly fall sick, it may reveal to the ghost that he knew of the ghost's existence. That would be using his life as stakes to gamble on the ghost's compassion.

Rick believed that there would be a safer method, a scapegoat to reduce suspicion, to expose the ghost and end his bad luck.

"Boss Quide. This time I will have to trouble you\!" Rick thought.

"It is unfortunate for the beggars such as Thales and Karak. It's certainly possible that certain troubles might have occurred because of my inadequate supervision. But when compared to my life and future…”

At this moment, the lucky thug who escaped returned quickly from a distance with a carriage.

Rick nodded to him and gave him a comforting and encouraging smile. He then went to the carriage and pulled out a mini crossbow that had its arrows soaked in Blue Vine Grass. He proceeded to shoot it into the wide-open mouth of the surprised thug.

…

What Rick did would never be known to the world. However, his actions would influence the fate of the kingdom.

Because their rest period had been shifted earlier, the beggars of the sixth house led by Thales sat next to the fire they had lighted with difficulty as they counted that day's earnings.

"The black-clothed woman gave us eight coppers. I heard that her youngest son had just died from typhoid. No wonder she was so generous."

"Droopy-ears Miralla gave us all her remaining coppers after grocery shopping… Oh, there were only two."

Sinti smiled and counted the coppers one-by-one, placing them in his left hand. Thales nodded and grabbed a sharp rock. He then wrote two '正' characters on the ground1.

"That thin man wearing high boots would not give us any money. So, Ryan and I taught him a lesson."

Kellet took out a card, looked at it worriedly and said, "However, he only had this card in his hand. I do not know what this is for."

"This is the pass for the state-run research association, Jade Star Grand Library. That is in the Upper District five blocks away from us," Thales said after he scrutinized the card, "That thin man must be a foreign scholar. He is probably a philosopher or a scientist. However, with his unconventional appearance, he is most likely a literature and art scholar."

"Wow, Thales\! You can read those words\!" Both Coria and Ned looked at Thales in admiration.

"How is that possible?" Thales shrugged as he noticed the admiration of the two children. "Nobody taught us how to read or count. I simply looked at the back of the card and saw that book emblem."

However, Thales had already taught himself how to read a little. Some of the words he learned were "Sunset Pub", "Grove Pharmacy", and "National Research Institute". These words on the signboards and his previous memories made him value knowledge. He would not pass up any opportunity to gather knowledge.

The freedom to sit at desks and learn from their predecessors was really a blessing. Thales lifted his dust-covered palms that had worked the whole day which were covered prematurely with calluses, then rubbed his stomach that was eternally hungry and sighed.

Thales could not remember his transmigration circumstances. To be precise, he only regained the memories of his past life after the gradual maturity of the young Thales' cerebrum.

His memory of when he was two to three years old was unclear, just like a regular two-year-old. He only remembered sticky red blood (he did not know why color could be described with the word sticky), a black stone room full of crying infants, a skinny woman who he would later on recognize as the 'Black-Hearted Widow' Behrs, the female leader responsible for raising the new children of the Brotherhood.

Thales was sent to the Abandoned Houses at the age of three. It was also about that time when memories of his past life began to surface. Most of the scenes he recalled were of himself sitting in front of a desk looking back and forth between a book and a computer or sitting in a classroom conversing with a dozen or so young people that were dressed differently or together with a middle-aged professor discussing something.

However, that was now an illusion.

In the past four years, Thales managed to maintain the living conditions of the beggars in the sixth house. This was in an environment of crime and death where beggars were beaten up and bullied in the Lower District.

Compared to his past life as a post-graduate student where he was more brain than brawn, Thales had acquired many new skills in his four years of his begging career. For example, putting on an act to win sympathy, pickpocketing, eavesdropping silently and collaborating with someone else to shift the blame.

In the meantime, Thales had made many preparations that exceeded the capabilities of a beggar. For example, creating good relationships with people from the different social strata (in the Lower District presumably they were from the lower strata), secretly exploring the secrets of the Brotherhood, arranging secret locations and stashing some stuff from the bosses. Quide was not wrong at all.

That was right. Thales was not ready to accept the destiny given to him by the world. He will not become a contented beggar nor did he want to become a thug of the Brotherhood, a thief, or involved in any kind of gang-related roles in Eternal Star City.

He wanted to run away, find his own life and become a free man.

At the very least, more freedom than his current life.

"I just need to proceed step-by-step with a good plan…”

Thales looked to a corner of the house where there was an inconspicuous slab stone.

'Then I can… I can… '

At this moment, screams of fear and panic came from the seventeenth house. "No\! Kara\!"

Soon, Thales would learn the most important lesson after he transmigrated.

Disaster strikes unexpectedly.

Chapter 5   
Mad Quide

The Abandoned Houses were not houses but the name of a location in Eternal Star City. It was located in the Lower City Second District, adjacent to the infamous Black Street. The entire area was also about the size of one street.

Thales once heard the elders of the Brotherhood mention that these Abandoned Houses were once the King of Constellation's courtyard. A hundred years ago, the buildings had a better name, but nobody remembered it. Only the city hall had records of it. It was once bustling and filled with ordinary city folk of the kingdom's capital.

At some point in time, it had turned into the meeting grounds of gangs and, occasionally, the battlegrounds of different factions.

As a result, the lively neighborhood was gradually stained with blood and steel. The place became abandoned with only tattered brick buildings remaining.

The Abandoned Houses were also treated as dead-lands for discarding dead bodies and so, to this day, children that grew up happily in the capital would be admonished with "If you are disobedient, I will send you to the Abandoned Houses." From then on, the notoriety of the Abandoned Houses was second only to the terrifying Black Street.

When the Black Street Brotherhood rose and seized control of supremacy in the underground world at the Lower City District, they turned the Abandoned Houses into the headquarters of the beggars' business.

In order to manage the beggars and prevent them from running away at night, they arranged thugs to watch every house. The Brotherhood dug trenches—ten feet wide and fifteen feet in depth—around the houses. They then filled the trenches with wood and rusted nails. The only entrance would be the front gate which could be locked up.

There were rumors that many people died trying to get out, but one person eventually managed to find a way to escape. However, in the four years Thales had been at the Abandoned Houses, nobody managed to find this legendary secret tunnel. Instead, the bodies in the trenches increased every year as the Brotherhood's business expanded. It was said that every year, there were children who did not know better and attempted to escape. This was also why the Brotherhood cleaned up the trenches of corpses once a year.

As its name suggests, the brick houses there were abandoned and there were a total of twenty-three houses. There would have been more but some had collapsed from the gang wars many years ago. There were also some that were demolished to dig trenches.

These houses were irregularly placed behind the gates. Some were close to each other while others were 'isolated'.

Beggars with good luck would be assigned to houses with wells. The unlucky ones, like Thales from the sixth house, would have to draw water from other houses to fill up their water jars—it was something priceless.

Water and food often caused the beggars to fight. One example was the water jar from the sixth house. In his second year there, Thales had used various methods to reach an agreement with the seventeenth house next door to obtain water once a week.

Before that, Ned and Coria have not arrived yet and there was only Sinti, Ryan, Kellet, and two other beggars who were already dead. At that time, even drinking water was a problem.

Right now, Thales heard the 'leader' of the seventeenth house, Diego's voice. Thales could still remember Diego's voice from the time that they had fought for water when he used a stone to smash Diego's head—it sounded very much like this one.

"Kara\! Someone\! We did not\! It wasn't us\!" Diego's voice sounded agonized and panicky.

As a result, all the beggars in the sixth house, including Thales, were unable to react for a moment. But Thales had memories that did not belong to this world, his first reaction was to take the others into the yard to hide in the hole behind the house.

After some time, Thales felt that it was too late to regret his decision. He glanced at the stone hidden under the wall of the seventeenth house. He stared at the dog tunnel that connected the seventeenth with the sixth house. This was the symbol of alliance between the children during those days.

"What happened to Diego? Did he get into a fight?" Ned asked curiously after hiding himself.

The child beggars did not exactly get along. Among the poor houses, the sixth house was an exception to this rule.

Many of the children's injuries can lead to death, aside from Quide, their injuries were usually caused by other child beggars—children below the age of ten do not know their own strength. One of Thales' housemates had also died like this before Ned and Coria arrived.

However, the seventeenth house was also one of the minorities. Diego was a brown-skinned, narrow-eyed blond. He was a carefree and stubborn child. At nine-and-a-half years old, he had more leadership qualities compared to Sinti and Thales. At the very least, the beggars of the seventeenth house listened to him. This also made the battle for water between the seventeenth and sixth houses full of twists.

"It doesn't seem like a fight. Are the other houses bullying Diego? It's surely the tenth house's Karak\! He loves bullying others\!" Kellet seemed to have thought of something and spoke hurriedly.

"Then we must hurry and go help\! We told them we would help each other." Ryan was about to climb out of the hole and climb into the dog tunnel when he was pulled back by Thales.

"Don't be impatient. It's not Karak\! It's something else\!" Thales listened solemnly to the horrible screams next door.

"No\! Diego\!"

After that, there was a blunt sound as though a sandbag was thrown to the wall. However, the voice this time came from a child named Ursula. Thales remembered this eight-year-old child. That time when the fight for water was over, Ursula had pouted tightly as she unwaveringly stood by Diego's side.

During the fight, it was she who held on to Sinti's thigh and prevented him from intruding onto Diego's and Thales' fight. Had Thales not violently attacked Diego's knee and quickly picked up a stone, they might not have had water to drink today.

"Something is wrong\!"

As the oldest child in the house, Sinti's expression began to turn somber. This sixth house member was the happiest and most willing to work together with Thales. Sinti rarely spoke, but when he does, it is either an important matter or a critical point.

Soon, the children's uncertainty turned into panic.

"Beg for mercy\! Beg for mercy\! Go on\! I love to hear you kids beg\!"

A vigorous and frenzied voice came from next door.

Every beggar in the Abandoned Houses would never forget this voice, it was more terrifying than the devils of hell. At the very least, a devil would not break a child beggar's bones inch by inch, or slash open their faces one slice after another. A devil would also not submerge a child beggar's face underwater and say that he was 'quenching your thirst' at the same time (At least, the child beggars did not know whether a devil would actually do it).

It was Quide.

Quide Roda, the leader of the beggars in the Black Street Brotherhood was both their nightmare and doomsday star.

"No\! Boss Quide\! We are wrong\! We… Argh\!"

"Let us see if you still dare to speak nonsense\! Let us see if you still dare to curse me behind my back\! Damn red-haired woman\! Damn baldy\! Damn Jala Charleton\! All of you should die\!"

While Quide cursed deliriously, the sounds of beatings and the sounds of fists, rocks, or bodies colliding against the wall was heard.

"Help\! Help\! Diego\! Kara\! Marita\! Hurry and get up\! Hurry and come save me\!"

"Run\! Run quickly— Argh—\!"

"Oh my God\! Where are the guards\! Where is Mister Rick\! Gods\! He wants to kill us all\!"

"No\! Don't\!"

Under the moonlight at the Abandoned Houses, heart-wrenching cries came from many mouths. Thales was shaken to the core\!

Thales took three seconds to react. What was Quide doing?

He turned around and looked at the others in the sixth house. Ned and Coria were trembling by the hole. Ryan, who had wanted to rush out, was already petrified.

Kellet and Sinti were not much better. The former's expression of impatience and fear rolled back and forth as he watched them—he wanted to speak but could not—the latter turned pale and stared back at Thales.

\*Bang\! Bang\! Bang\!\*

"All of you damn trash\! Even you guys dare to ridicule me\! You dare to ridicule 'Blood Axe' Quide Roda\! Even you guys dare… Haha, scream\! Why are you guys not screaming? Scream\!"

The frenzied roars were accompanied by agonizing screams. Everyone did not want to think too deeply about the broken voices.

Thales knew that at this moment, panic has spread in the sixth house. He quickly thought of the current situation.

Quide is beating up the beggars in the seventeenth house. No, just by listening to him, and the intensity of his beatings, tonight's attack is not something as simple as venting. Besides that, Quide may be an asshole, but he wouldn't attack everyone in the house at the same time…

What about Rick? What about the guards and patrolling thugs? They may not be able to hear from across the stone walls, but the thugs patrolling on the roads should be able to hear it\!

Naturally, Thales did not know that the forces guarding the place had been reduced to two for the night. On top of that, these two thugs would never return.

"Thales. What do we do?" Kellet instinctively felt that something was wrong from listening to the tragic events next door. He was pale and sweating as he continued to ask Thales.

"Quiet. Everyone is not allowed to go out\! We…” Thales frowned and struggled to think of a countermeasure. Before he could finish, a child beggar's figure appeared at the dog tunnel connecting the seventeenth and the sixth houses.

Coria cried out quietly in fear.

Thales recognized who it was from a quick glance. Coming from the seventeenth house was Ursula whose head was bleeding and about to collapse. Before Thales could help her up, Ursula fell down, gasping for breath and totally oblivious of her blood-drenched face and hair.

"Run\! Run quickly\! We must quickly…”

Thales and Sinti nervously helped her up. The tragic screams still continued but Ursula seemed to have lost her sanity. She could no longer answer questions except to simply murmur "run quickly" over and over again.

Until Thales slapped her in the face.

"What is going on? Did Quide come out?"

Ursula's tears kept streaming down.

"Qu… Quide has gone mad\! He wants… not just us\! He intends to look for us in each house one-by-one\!"

Ursula was already incoherent with her words but it was enough for the children of the sixth house to understand what was going on. All of them turned pale. Even Thales could not help but feel fear in his heart.

"When he sees someone, he hits and beats them until they stop breathing… I heard crying and went to the third house to take a look. I saw him drag Larry out. There was so much blood when he walked out. He then saw me…”

"He caught Kara. Kara was smashed into the ground. Diego wanted to stop him but took a few hundred hits, Diego became motionless… Then there was Marita. Quide threw her into the bonfire… sniffs… bonfire…”

Thales could feel his scalp go numb.

Thales had seen Quide beat people up before, but he would usually be stopped by the other thugs when the child was on the verge of death. The Brotherhood did not care if the abused child received permanent injuries.

"The third house is finished. Our house is, too… He was beating up Midelan just now. I don't know how many houses are left…”

The weeping and lamenting Ursula had not yet finished speaking but Thales suddenly covered her mouth. At this moment, through Thales' actions, everyone realized that the crying and the roaring from next door had stopped. The seventeenth house was quiet as though the children were asleep.

Only ragged panting could be heard. Nobody knew what it meant.

In the sixth house, all the children began to tremble. In that instant, Thales quickly turned and lowered his voice as much as he could. "Listen. We must quickly…”

\*Bang\!\*

A loud noise was suddenly heard. The doors to the sixth house were opened.

From the entrance, Quide's shaky figure slowly approached. He looked at the seven trembling children with a fierce and hideous grin.

"Where… where can you run? Eh? You… you look familiar…”

Everyone in the sixth house, including Thales, were stunned.

Quide rubbed his nose. Thales saw a bright red color on his face—the color of a drunk person. Quide's hands were dark red—the color of blood.

Quide looked at Thales who was covering Ursula's mouth.

"I- I remember you\!" His expressions shifted constantly between a sinister leer to rage and resentment. "Ah, you're that kid that was caught by that damn baldy… It's you\! You must be the one ridiculing me and running your mouth behind my back\! Am I right? It must be you… It must be you\!"

Thales' heart felt ice-cold.

……

Rick cautiously drove the carriage while he forced himself to calm down. All the while, he felt the temperature behind his neck. Fortunately, everything was normal and the ghost did not appear.

It would probably be a headache for Quide.

At that time, he approached the headquarters of the Black Street Brotherhood. Rick breathed a sigh of relief.

"Accountant\!" Came Layork's voice, the assassin from the Brotherhood shouted about twenty feet away from Rick. Layork's face appeared from a distance as if it was under the torchlight. He seemed dissatisfied and asked, "Why did you come here at this time? This here is dangerous business\! Even you with your account-balancing hands are thinking of joining the fun?"

Rick froze for a moment. As the carriage continued moving, he saw that the small public square in front of the headquarters was covered with torches.

All of them were standing quietly. All of them wore black cloth around them. The ones wearing these black clothes were members of the Brotherhood and there were at least a few hundred people.

Rick suddenly realized that almost all of the Brotherhood's manpower were here.

Rick quickly got down from the carriage. He hastily walked a few steps. Under the moonlight, he saw his superior, the fat Morris, who was also the big shot in the trafficking business. He was discussing something with a few figures with strange silhouettes. A two-meters-tall, blond giant; a mysterious figure in dark-red robes; and a fat, simple-looking man.

Rick was shocked; he recognized them.

These were big-shots from other places in the Brotherhood. There were even a few bosses that would normally not stay in Eternal Star City.

Rick moved through the fully equipped fighters that were armed with a variety of weapons from axes to knives, to blades or spiked maces as they sorted their equipment and walked straight to Layork.

"Layork, it is great to see… never mind. I won't speak of nonsense. What's going on tonight?"

Rick and Layork did not like each other, they met often simply because of their jobs, and they have a tacit understanding and agreement with each other.

However, the one who knew most about the situation and also the quickest person to ask would be Layork.

"The boss didn't tell you?" Layork pursed his mouth in disdain and threw him a glance, "As usual, confrontation with the Blood Bottle Gang. Besides the Mystic Gun and the infantry bows, we can use every other weapon…”

The famously efficient and ruthless assassin ran his hand over the scimitar behind his waist, as though feeling the sharpness of the blade.

Rick was startled. Confronting the Blood Bottle Gang…

The assassin took a deep breath. He then laughed and licked his lips, "Tonight, we will capture the Red Street Market."

……

"Still no news from Yodel? What about the Sunset Temple?"

The middle-aged noble with gray hair was in front of a fireplace, facing a luxurious chair and asked somberly, "Patience, my friend. We have waited for twelve years, it does not matter if we were to wait a little longer."

The robust figure rose from the chair and grabbed the handle of a scepter that was inlaid with light blue crystals. Looking closely, the crystals of the scepter seemed to twinkle in a slow and steady rhythm.

"Our pointless conjectures here only casts doubt on Yodel's ability. Furthermore, is he not carrying the flame of the Lamp? I believe he is close to the target and simply needs to make a final confirmation." The robust figure said slowly.

The middle-aged noble gave a deep bow.

"I do not doubt Yodel's ability, nor have I ever underrated his loyalty. It is just…” The man paused and sighed. "He is too calm and callous. Other than his unwavering loyalty, he is not interested in anything else. Just like twelve years ago. I am worried that he…”

The middle-aged man did not continue, the robust figure also did not immediately reply.

The robust figure carried the scepter and went to the floor-to-ceiling window. He looked out the windows at the resplendent lights of the great shrine in the distance.

Even the moonlight could not compete with the brightness of that shrine.

"Then prepare yourself and secretly proceed to the temple… Begin the moment there is news, there is no need to wait for Yodel's signal."

After a while, the robust figure slowly added, "I have no reason to doubt Yodel. When he needs to act, he will not hesitate.

"However, it is good to have more than one hand prepared."

The First Drop of Blood

By the time Thales recovered, Quide had grabbed him by the neck and lifted him up.

Thales struggled as he held on to the hand strangling his neck. However, he could not seem to gather his strength. He tried desperately to open his mouth but could not breathe. His two legs kept kicking as he began to feel faint.

The hubbub around him sounded muffled, as though they were blocked by a thick cloth. Coria was crying, Ryan had curled himself up at the hole and trembled continuously, Kellet was sitting in front of the wall, terrified and whimpering.

Sinti and Ned screamed as they boldly rushed forward fearlessly. One held on to Quide's thigh, the other struck Quide's belly with his small arms.

Sinti was blown away and crashed into the water jar, spilling water all over the yard. Ned was ruthlessly struck by Quide. He screamed as he fell onto the ground, unable to get up.

Thales did not have the time or the mood to be surprised at Ned's courage, or Kellet's and Ryan's cowardice (he was quite certain of Sinti's actions). Thales firmly used his fingernails to dig into Quide's hand that held his neck. He wanted to break free so that he could breathe.

Suddenly, Thales' nail sank into the back of Quide's right hand, digging into a hollow wound. Thales' face had already turned red by then, so he did not hesitate and desperately dug into the wound.

"Argh\!"

Quide screamed from the pain. His loosened his iron-grip and then threw Thales towards a wall. Thales felt dizzy and his throat felt sore. He leaned against the wall as he coughed uncontrollably.

Quide clutched his palm. On top of it was the wound made by Jala which had started bleeding again.

"Damn Jala Charleton\! Damned brat\!"

Quide endured the pain as he roared furiously and drunkenly.

\*Crack\!\*

The ferocious Quide suddenly turned around and saw only the child from the seventeenth house, Ursula, frantically trying to escape through the door. The door that had just collapsed earlier from Quide's trampling could not support her weight and had cracked open.

"Haha. Are you trying to run?"

Quide grinned hideously and strode forward. He then grabbed Ursula's left leg.

"No\! Don't\!"

Ursula cried out as Quide lifted her up by her leg.

"Brat. Have you struck iron before? No? Haha. Don't worry, I'll teach you\!"

Thales climbed up in pain and was only in time to see Quide swing Ursula's left leg with both arms and smashed her head against the wall behind him.

Thales had just enough time to reflexively move out of the way.

The crown of the head made a compressed sound. It was the same sound as when he once saw the fruit seller smash open an Ellend melon.

That's right. We stole the Luminous Moon statue from that very person.

Coria's wail turned into a shrill scream. Thales was stunned and could not close his eyes in time. Red and white liquid splashed onto his face. It was warm, yet cold.

Ned had witnessed everything when he crawled up from the ground. He screamed as he collapsed. He then headed towards the dog tunnel leading towards the seventeenth house.

Quide opened his mouth and inhaled, looking intoxicated. It was as though he did not inhale air but black pine wine of the highest grade. This demon in human skin turned around and dropped whatever was left of Ursula. He then looked at Ned with a vigorous smile.

At that moment, Thales thought for a moment that Ned was small and nimble, and that Ned would be able to dig into the dog tunnel before Quide could reach him.

Dig into that hole and everything will be fine.

Dig and you will be safe.

Dig in.

Dig in.

Dig.

However, before Ned could dig halfway in, Quide grabbed Ned's legs.

"Are you the brat that had no money to give? Then what good are you?"

Ned screamed as he was dragged out of the hole by Quide.

"Scream\! Your screams are not wretched enough\! It is a pity that the water jar is broken. We cannot play fishing anymore."

Quide shook his head to dispel the dizziness caused by the alcohol. He gazed at Sinti who had just got up from the ground and the water jar beside him.

"That makes things easy."

Ned wailed and kicked. Quide grabbed his face and slammed him onto the ground. He then lifted the six-year old's right foot and ruthlessly stepped onto the center of the six-year-old beggar's back.

"Don't\!"

\*Boom\! Crack\!\*

A heart-stopping crack resounded at the same time as Thales' heart-wrenching cry.

Everything in front of Thales blurred.

\*Boom\!\*

Quide stepped a second time.

\*Boom\!\*

A third time.

Crying out loud with the greatest effort ever, Sinti grabbed a fragmented piece of the water jar and charged towards Quide. Quide simply laughed and kicked away the fragment in Sinti's hand. He then grabbed Sinti's hemp collar and lifted him up.

Looks like I can't do anything.

Thales lowered his head. By the wall, Ursula's body was still quietly twitching. Ned was sprawled face-down on the ground, motionless.

I thought I was protecting them but I'm unable to do anything. I couldn't do anything.

Sinti roared as he kicked. Quide's high-pitched laughter became even more aggravated.

"Brat. Scream\! Keep screaming\! I love to hear you all scream\! Maybe my mood will improve and I would let all of you go\!"

Thales' eyes turned dim as he recalled a familiar scene.

"Deviant behaviour. This is what we define human behavior that opposes social norms. An average person is more accustomed to calling it crime. However, we must know that crimes are only one small part of deviation. What we are concerned about is not the act but the meaning at a social level and its comprehension. Durkheim was one of the earliest scholars to start sociology. He also looked at deviation from the functionalist angle…

"One viewpoint is that the enforcement and punishment of deviant acts is one of the ways the authority shapes and models the basic structure of society…”

This was a fragment of the memories from Thales' past life. He had recovered some of it just a moment ago.

"Demon\! You demon\!"

Just then, Sinti's roar and kicks dispersed Thales' vision.

"Yes\! I am a devil\!" Quide laughed. "Tell me, how would a devil cook you?"

Thales took a deep breath.

Damned bastard.

His mind was as clear as ever. He knew what to do. He knew what he should do. Thales clenched his teeth, turned around and rushed to a corner of the house. There, he grabbed a stone, lifted it up, and stretched his hand into the hole hidden underneath.

Quick. Quickly find it.

"Alright. Since you have guts, I'll leave you for last."

Quide laughed until his lips went crooked. He fiercely pulled Sinti's right leg until Sinti's face turned pale and then…
