"The very one," Malden confirmed.

Elias scratched his beard thoughtfully. "But aren't there rumours of Tradeheart… well, eyeing the Arzan estates? Planning a takeover perhaps?"

A hearty laugh escaped Malden's lips. "Rumors, Elias, nothing more. Lord Arzan is a man of… unorthodox methods, but his plans are always grand. And I can assure you, Tradeheart will soon be singing a different tune. Perhaps even finding themselves on the streets."

26. Morning drill


A note from Extra26





The Academy's Professor is Overpowered!





The long war between Humans and Demons finally came to an end, leaving young Ethan without a job. Fortunately, he was hired to teach in the greatest academy on the continent. Unfortunately, all the big shots from all over the world were sent straight to his classroom. At least the pay is good... it is, right?



About the Story: The story is less of an action fantasy and more of a character drama. You can expect a lot of badassery and comedy along with the emotional growth of Ethan and all his annoying yet lovable students.



Updates: Daily at 8:30 PM GMT/International Time!





The pre-dawn air hung crisp and cool. The season was still at its peak as Kai stepped onto the worn training grounds, the chilly air hitting him on his face.



His eyes looked everywhere until they stopped at Killian.



He ran in front of the guards, being a few steps ahead of the rest of them.



The guards were running in lines, their faces drawn in a mixture of exhaustion as they struggled to match Killian's pace.



The latter was a whirlwind of energy.

Kai was still quite far from the group, but he could hear Killian’s powerful and clear voice, cutting through the silence of the morning around the estate.

"Come on, you lot move like arthritic snails! A goblin horde won't wait for your yawns and stretches!"

He spun around. His fiery eyes swept over the guards. His gaze lingered on a burly man, his chest heaving and shoulders slumped.

"You there, Thoren! Are you planning to sleep-walk through the entire run? Put more effort into your legs and get in shape. We need to be fit and strong to protect the common people!"

His voice was commanding. The guard, whose name Kai realised Thoren, mumbled something inaudible, his broad frame slumping further. Killian, however, wasn't deterred.

“Come on, you lazy lot! I want to see those knees up higher! Move it, move it!” His voice echoed across the grounds, mingling with the rhythmic sounds of boots pounding against the earth.

Kai continued to stare at them. Killian wasn’t just running and training the morning drill; he was embodying them.

On top of it all, his frustration with the guards’ lack of enthusiasm was evident. He barked commands at the guards.

He had heard from Francis that before Killian, the guards had been lazy and since he had taken command, they had been pushed to work harder. A few had even lost their jobs because they were too out of shape to be trained well in a few months.

In the expedition, he had only taken the best guards they had, but if he thought about the whole unit, they certainly needed them to be stronger and fitter.

A bead of sweat trickled down Kai’s temple as he continued to observe. He couldn’t help but compare his morning routine to the training drill. It wasn't like he was lazy, but unlike the guards, most of his work wasn't a burden on his body.

I need to be more physical.

Before he could think further, a loud voice yelled, “Halt, guards!”. Killian spun around. His gaze, previously focused on the guards, narrowed as he saw Kai in the distance.

The training ground fell silent.

Killian straightened and dipped his head in a curt bow. The guards mirrored his action and bowed in unison.

Killian said something inaudible to the guards and jogged towards Kai. The guards followed him and came closer to Kai.

Their motions were in unison as they stood in some distance, looking nervous at his presence.

“Lord Arzan,” Killian’s voice held a hint of formality yet remained laced with his usual gruffness. “Here to watch our morning deficiencies?”

Kai shook his head, a slight smile playing at the corner of his lips.

Killian’s eyes tempered with a flicker of curiosity.

"Actually," Kai said, his voice steady, "I believe I'm here to participate."

If he could, Kai would have captured the look on Killian's face as his brows shot up in disbelief, looking like he was wondering if he should laugh at the joke or if it was serious.

Once he realised it was, he scowled. His lips pursed, about to voice what was likely a sharp retort. But before a single word could escape, Kai was already in motion.

He launched into a sprint. His black hair whipped behind him, the morning dew sparkling on his emerald cloak.

"Just a few rounds, then," he called back over his shoulder, his voice laced with authority. "Consider it an... order."

The word hung heavy in the air. Killian was momentarily speechless. The guards looked the same, looking baffled.

Looking back, Kai saw Killian speaking something to the guards and then, with a resigned sigh, he mimicked his movements.

His long strides quickly ate into the distance between them. The guards scrambled to their feet as they fell into line behind Killian.

Kai, who gave a small glance behind, ran forward.

The training ground was big enough for him to pant after just the first round. But his movements were sharp as they made it to the second round.

It has been quite some time since he ran this much in such a short period, but his legs carried him. And like that, he was in the third round.

He could hear Killian’s feet right behind him. He seemed to be keeping a close distance with him and although Kai was full of sweat and taking deep breaths, the knight looked like he was casually strolling through a garden.

Soon, sweat trickled down Kai’s forehead, blurring his vision as even his eyes were covered in them. His breaths came in ragged gasps, and his muscles screamed in protest.

Two more rounds, I’ve got this.

Kai felt his leg movement slowing down. He didn’t want to stop, but despite his best efforts, his legs began to wobble.

Killian, who was right beside him, noticed the shift.

“Halt, everyone!”

His voice echoed across the training ground.

The guards, panting but exhilarated, slowed down to a swift halt.

“Huff!”

Kai stumbled to a stop, his chest heaving and his legs threatening to give away as he lowered to the ground. Killian was at his side in an instant. He barked an order to a nearby guard, which Kai couldn’t hear properly.

Kai felt deaf for a brief second, the only thing he heard clearly was his heartbeat thumping loudly.

“Easy there, Lord Arzan,” Killian rasped. “You pushed yourself further than expected.”

He helped Kai regain his balance.

“Just keep going,” Kai gasped, his voice was rough with exertion. He gestured weakly to the guards.

“Are you sure?” Killian asked once more.

Kai looked up to see how concerned Killian was. His eyebrows creased and his lips formed into a thin line. Even through sweat and heavy breaths, his concern looked evident.

“I’ll be alright. I’ll rest by the tree.”

“I already sent someone to ask for water,” Killian said.

Kai nodded and pointed at the guards. “Head back and continue.”

Killian simply nodded.

Kai turned his back and started making his way to the nearby tree. His limbs were shaky as he slowly walked out of the ground. Under the tree, the bench was perfectly positioned.

When he walked towards the bench, he heard Killian’s orders as the guards continued the drill.

He sat on the bench and placed his hands on his knees. The sting that came from his bones was something he hadn’t expected. It was mainly due to how long it had been since he physically exhausted himself with any sort of workout.

He had felt the same during the skirmish with the necromancer, but back then, adrenaline had let him continue.

A few seconds passed by with him just trying to catch his breath.

From the corner of his eye, he saw Claire walking toward him with a canteen of water in her hand.

Kai sat straight and took the water from her.

"Are you alright, Lord Arzan?" she asked gently, her voice laced with worry.

Kai took a long swig of the water. Before he could reply, he needed to quench his parched throat. He paused before bringing it to his lips and taking another long sip.

When he felt enough, he put it down and looked at her concerned eyes.

"Too weak," he rasped, the words a stark contrast to his usual confident demeanour. "I can't... can't afford to be weak. Not anymore. I can't even run for long."

“You will get there, Lord Arzan. You are not used to it. It's been a long time since you took part in training, right?” Claire asked as a matter of fact.

Kai simply nodded. “Yes, been a while, but I’ve to work on my body now. Anyway, thanks for bringing the water.” he paused. His eyes fell on the guards who were training restlessly.

A part of him, the Magus who had gone through dangerous situations, wanted to start running again, but he knew he would pass out and had to be dragged away if he tried. He didn't want to show the guards such a scene, especially when his reputation had improved recently.

A part of being a good Mage was also to know when to stop and take a rest.

Claire smiled seeing him finish the canteen.

A sigh escaped his lips as he realised he had much to improve physically.

From afar, he could see how hard the guards were training. Their run and touch-down drill made a few guards take pauses in between.

He finally saw Killian saying something to the guards and looking at Kai’s side.

The guards saluted Killian in unison as he turned around and made his way towards Kai.

“Feeling better now, Lord Arzan?” Killian asked as he approached.

Kai smiled at him and gestured for him to sit next to him. Taking the moment, Claire walked away as she knew better than to listen to their conversation.

Kai got to the topic without wasting any time. “I plan on joining your training every day from now on.”

Killian’s eyes widened at the statement. “Every day?” he asked, surprised. “You’re a Mage, Lord Arzan. You don’t have to train like the guards for battles,” he spoke his mind.

Kai shook his head. “There’s more to being a Mage than just spells, Killian. What if my mana runs out in the heat of battle? What if I need to dodge an attack, outrun an enemy, or even fight with something more than magic?”

He looked at the guards moving in perfect unison, their bodies honed for combat. Then, glanced down at his own body which was less than ideal.

It was normal for an average Mage, but Kai didn't like being average.

“I need to be more than just a walking fireball, Killian. I need to be quick on my feet, strong, and capable of surviving even when my magic fails me.”

Killian studied him for a moment.

Kai wasn’t joking in any sense. The practising wasn’t for a hobby or to pass his time. He needed to get in better shape because he didn’t know what more challenges lay ahead.

“A wise decision, Lord Arzan.” He finally conceded. “But be warned, these drills are meant to push us to our limits. They aren’t for the faint of heart.”

A grin stretched across Kai’s face. “I got a bit of a taste of it.”

Killian slowly nodded. “I’d be honoured to tailor a training regimen that strengthens both your body and reflexes. We can start from tomorrow if you still manage to walk fine after all the running you did. It would be inappropriate if all of your training is with the guards.”

“Yes, that’d be great.” Kai glanced briefly at the guards. “And,” he continued, his gaze returning to Killian, “in the coming days, I plan to recruit additional members for the guards.”

“Oh?” Killian’s forehead furrowed. “I will be happy to welcome them but is it necessary right now?”

Kai smiled with a concealed motive and replied, “I’m not going to recruit any ordinary guards.”

“What do you mean, Lord Arzan? Who-”

Kai cut him off short. “I will show you something once I confirm it. I just need some time.”

The guards finally halted in their actions and stood straight.

“Yes, for sure. I’ll be waiting to find out who they are. And that’s my cue to attend to them,” Killian pointed towards the guards who were waiting and stood up.

Kai didn’t say anything but nodded, watching him leave.

***

Kai looked at the diverse visuals of the items that were on display before them. They were the stuff they had retrieved from the necromancer's lair.

Francis stood beside him. His weathered face was covered with a mixture of satisfaction and wariness.

"Quite the haul, wouldn't you say, Lord Arzan?" Francis rumbled, gesturing towards the spoils of their venture.

Kai crouched down, his black eyes scanning the assortment.

There was a staff, its vibrant wood dulled and emanating a faint, unsettling chill. It lay propped against a carved chest filled with gold coins. Next to it, dust-covered tomes with leather bindings sat.

“Did you get more information about him?” He asked, glancing back at him.

Francis nodded and knelt beside him, his voice low and grave. "The necromancer, it seems, hailed from a small academy deep within the Duchy of Blackwood. His name was Vincent Laksob, a Mage working as a professor in the Blackwood Academy there. He coveted the post of the headmaster and once he failed to get it after the current headmaster retired, he seemed to have turned on them."

“Just because of that?”

“He seemed to have thought becoming the headmaster would let him have more resources to rank up since he was stuck as a 3rd circle Novice Mage for a long time.”

Even in his past life, Kai had seen a lot of Mages who had lost their mind or turned to dark paths if they were stuck in the same circle for a long time. A few he had trained with had the same fate.

His face scrunched up and swallowing the bitterness, he forced his attention back to Francis.

“He seemed to have gotten a book on necromancy and practised dark arts in secret for a while," Francis continued, his voice laced with disgust. “There were a few reports I got and the man was heinous. He once grazed a small village with his undead and whoever was killed became a soldier in his army. He even raised undead from a graveyard."

Kai stood, his gaze lingering on the macabre tomes.

"The Blackwood Duchy," Francis said, his voice regaining its gruffness, "is more than grateful for our assistance. They've requested a detailed report, of course. And," he added with a grin, "they've agreed to honour the bounty on his head, along with some additional… compensation, considering the extra effort involved."

Kai nodded curtly. His eyes lingered on the collection. Each item gave off a strange, unsettling feel to him, especially the staff. It was the same one he had been using in their fight.

"We'll have to dispose of all this," he said finally, his voice low and firm. "Burn it, every last piece."

The staff might have good enchantments on it, but a necromancer's staff wasn't something he wanted to store in his house. As for the books, he wouldn't want any other person to take a look through them and fall to the path of necromancy.

His eyes fell to the tomes, eyeing each of them carefully. He would have to make sure to burn—

What’s that?

His eyes fixated on a book, tucked almost discreetly among the leather-bound tomes. The book was different. Even the cover of the book showed intricate diagrams of metallic and clay figures instead of skeletal ones.

His curiosity piqued, and Kai reached out and grabbed it. The worn leather was cold against his fingertips.

He flipped it open immediately.

Reading through the columns of it, his eyes widened as he saw all the patterns and texts that weren't related to any dark arts but were incredibly interesting.

Materials, enchantments, animating constructs— golems.

A book on Golemancy!

[kingdom building] [Funny A.I. sidekick] [Progression LitRPG] [Regeneration Tank Hero]



*Spoiler Below*





This story has an MC that uses a symbiote enabled magic/cultivation system fused with an A.I. driven set of augmentations and technologies to overcome challenges, and dominate his enemies. Join Ryker and his group of unlikely companions on their journey to power.





Kai’s eyes narrowed in concentration as he looked at the book in his hand. He cautiously flipped open the cover, and a faint scent of aged paper tickled his nose. The yellow papers had his sole attention.

He turned pages one after the other. He couldn’t help but be absorbed in the letters, lines and curves that were inside it.

It was written in Manakrit, a language often used for magical art. Kai had read books in it all his life and although the ones here had words and sentences that he was unfamiliar with, he had adapted.

“What is it, Lord Arzan?” Francis questioned curiously, breaking his focus.

“Well…” Kai started but his eyes were glued on the books.

A moment of silence passed as Kai kept reading as much as he could.

He saw Francis leaving the question behind and bending down to look at the other belongings of the necromancer.

The first few pages were detailed sketches of various golem designs. Their forms ranged from hulking and imposing to sleek and agile.

There were ones made from clay, wood, and metal and one small drawing of what looked like a golem that seemed to have been scribbled as a pastime.

As he turned the pages, his heart skipped a beat.

Among the diagrams were handwritten notes, the ink a faded brown, hinting at years of study.

Most of the notes were in Manakrit, but from time to time, there were languages like Elfham, an ancient language of the elves that human scholars would sometimes learn the basics of.

There were also different handwritings, meaning that it had been passed down a lot.

This must be quite old.

With just one look, he could say that the notes spoke of different materials— enchanted metals, infused clays, and even rare, alchemically treated wood— each possessing unique properties that imbued the finished golem with specific strengths and weaknesses.

The written material made his eyebrows knit together. There was considerable detail and dedication that was put into explaining everything.

Hmm.

His fingertip halted in between pages. Besides the words that were written in Manakrit, there were some scribbled notes in the common tongue that he assumed came from the necromancer.

Kai squinted his eyes trying to look at them closely, but the dim light made it harder for him to focus on the insides.

He closed the book gently. It didn’t seem like a mere reference book on golems. It was a personal journal passed down to a lot of people, including the necromancer. The notes and the creases that were in the book were evidence of how long the journey of the journal had been.

On the other hand, golemancy itself was a rare and misunderstood school of magic.

Unlike necromancy, which manipulated the deceased, golemancy focused on the creation of sentient constructs. It was an art steeped in history, practised by ancient civilizations who used golems for construction, defence and even companionship.

Kai vaguely remembered the rumours passed in whispers, of a kingdom far to the east ruled by a powerful mage who employed an army of golems. He didn't know if it was true, or if it even existed in the current era, but it was a famous story to tell whenever golemancy would come up.

However, the art had faded into obscurity by the time he had begun his magic training.

But, how did this book end up in the possession of a necromancer?

He finally glanced at Francis, his voice layered with surprise.

“Francis,” he inquired gaining his attention from where he was staring at the staff, “was there any indication that the necromancer practised… golemancy?”

The latter stood up from the crouched position and stroked his beard thoughtfully.

“Yes, Lord Arzan,” his eyes widened. “I remember several notations like that in the report sent by the Blackwood Duchy. He had it as one of his magical arts.” He paused for a moment. Before Kai could say anything he continued. “From what I gathered, his knowledge of golemancy was what allowed him to grasp the fundamentals of necromancy quicker than most. It is quite sad if you ask me. He was a Mage, someone countless people would do anything to be in his shoes, but he threw it away.”

Francis said, heaving a sigh in the end.

Although Kai agreed with his sentiments, his attention was on something else. Looking down, he dusted off the book.

The necromancer learnt the basic necromancy through golemancy. That’s interesting.

A wave of realisation washed over Kai.

He guessed that the necromancer tried to master golemancy and since both magical arts overlapped on controlling other beings, no matter how different they were, he was able to master necromancy easily.

With golems, he must have been working on his enchantment skills since those two gelled well together.

It explained certain things about his fighting style and as Kai made more conjuntions about the necromancer, Francis took his attention.

“If you want more details, I can request from the Duchy, My Lord. They would be happy to provide us with more information,” he said while looking at Kai and searching for an answer in his facial expressions.

Kai shook his head. “I will let you know if I need them.” He lifted the book that was in his hand. “I’ll take a good look at this book, Francis.” He pointed at the rest. “But these… They need to be purged immediately. Burn them, every last one of them.”

Francis scrunched up his nose. “I agree, Lord Arzan. They reek of something disgusting. I will burn them right now,” he said and nodded.

Kai understood that he was referring to the scent of the necromancer's cave that was still in the air that was on his belongings.

It was indeed disgusting.

***

The flickering flame of a single candle emitted dancing shadows on Kai’s face as he sat hunched over his desk.

His face was close to the book as he tried to take a look at the patterns and designs that were etched on the cover of the book. The scent of the aged pages mixed with dust hit his nostrils.

Although he took a glance at the book when he was with Francis, he wanted to go deeper into it. The subject interested him for several reasons.

Without thinking further, he opened it.

He traced his finger across the diagrams he first saw that depicted figures of clay, stone, cloth, and metal. Besides the diagram, the descriptions of them were explained in Manakrit language.

Kai paused for a moment and started reading them.

In the initial pages, there were a few details on golemancy. The details included the materials that could be used and in which ways.

It was a basic introduction telling the reader about how to go on with selecting the right materials for the golem.

Something caught his eye as he continued reading.

It was mentioned that depending on the materials and enchantments, different powers could be manipulated. But the heart of every golem, the text mentioned, lay within the core.

This wasn’t a singular object, but it was rather crafted by fusing alchemical concoctions and materials harvested from vanquished monsters.

I have only seen one golem core before and it barely functioned.

Kai thought back to the time he had been in an artificial dungeon where he had found a room with golems in it. They weren't operative and most of them were in bad shape. There, he had seen the core of it, but it wasn't in a shape to be studied.

He turned the page and saw a pulsating, red orb labelled “Dungeon Core.” The text explained that these rare cores could act as an alternative to the standard golem core, granting the construct life force and even a rudimentary form of sentience.

A shiver ran down his spine as he read it. Looking back, he saw the window open and closed with an easy-to-do wind spell.

His eyes fell on a scrawled note in the margin of the page. The ink was a darker shade than the rest of the text. The handwriting seemed like someone had been in a hurry.

Too expensive.

The note read. It was written after circling one of the few materials that was needed to craft one of the golem designs. Nevertheless, the two words had been underlined several times for emphasis.

On the next page, there were other freshly-inked words.

Materials alone cost a fortune, even with bartering with those damned dwarves. Enchantments getting better, but the coin purse is running dry faster than my patience.

Kai frowned, and a jolt of understanding shot through him.

It seemed like the necromancer liked to write down his thoughts and struggles while going through the book. It was not just a book on golemancy, but also a personal journal for him.

Though, he had to say that his handwriting was bad.

They were cursive and the letters barely connected their lines and curves properly. It looked like he had been writing in frustration and didn't even bother properly scribbling a few words.

Kai placed his finger under the notes, reading them once again. Quickly, he started turning pages to find if there were more notes.

Like he thought, there were a few other notes in different places as he read through.

The man had known the art of golem, maybe even had the ambition to master golemancy. But the cost of materials, and limitations of the resources he had led him to another path.

He must have wanted to take revenge, but golems were too expensive. Unlike them, the undead could be raised easily from a cemetery.

He didn’t need coins, nor rare metals or build up a space to do golemancy experiments.

Kai flipped back a few pages, his eyes landing on the section detailing dungeon cores.

Another note filled the margin. The letters were written in a bolder hand.

Dungeon core! Answer to everything! Power, life force, minimal cost! Just need to… experiment.

Kai sighed.

The necromancer was desperate… and needy. The details and the necromancer’s scribbles implanted in his mind— the high cost of the materials, the limitations of traditional magic.

He let out a humourless chuckle.

Even if the necromancer was desperate, he had taken up getting corrupted and turned into a lich rather than being an honourable Mage. In the end, it had cost him his life.

In a way, the necromancer wouldn’t have been the first, nor the last to be lured by dark magic just out of sheer desperation.

But the pages felt extremely interesting. The way the details were described to the way even little details mattered— it was all fascinating. Apart from the details on the golemancy, taking a peek into the necromancer’s mind was also intriguing.

Maybe… trying golem wouldn’t be impossible. Kai suddenly thought. The book, the notes— they were all too tempting.

In his past life, he had taken alchemy as a primary magical art, and only took a basic interest in the other types of arts that his master and other Mages taught around the Sorcerer's Tower.

Alchemy had its perks that Kai was drawn to— the resourcefulness, the experimentation including many other aspects made him master alchemy with need.

But he had always been interested in building things.

His eyes fell back on the book. He traced the diagrams of the simpler golems. the hulking stone brute, the nimble wooden scout – the possibilities swirled in his mind.

A major reason the necromancer wasn't able to build golems was the cost and wanted to get dungeon cores to facilitate it, but going into a dungeon was dangerous. He was desperate.

But Kai wasn't a desperate man. He, however, understood alchemy, a discipline built on meticulous control and precise calculations.

He also had access to a noble's resources, a luxury the necromancer hadn't. The sheer allure of golemancy and its potential tugged at him with an irresistible force.

A mischievous grin spread across his face. If he were to take this path, it wouldn’t be easy. It would need meticulous planning, a fusion of his alchemical expertise and a lot of help from the book he found. The rewards though— he could make groundbreaking discoveries.

The smile on his face faded as he remembered he still had other stuff on his agenda. The girl they rescued, recruiting more people, and even the castle affairs.

They all required his attendance.

But mastering a useful art wouldn’t do any harm. I can try making some basic models that are in here and see where it goes.

He closed the book with a thoughtful thump. He stood up and walked to his bed, all the while thinking about golems.

The girl they brought back from the cave was kept in the building where a few castle workers stayed. They all were in different rooms far from Amyra and were asked not to disturb her unless she needed something.

Kai knew the maids were curious about her due to her rare features and the reason he had kept her safe, but they followed his direct orders.

The room— it wasn’t anything luxurious, but was spacious and had enough walls to protect her privacy. A small bed, a lamp, a few books and clothes were brought to her on the first day.

Kai sat next to her in the small space over the bed where she had her arms extended towards him. Her back was hunched in an uncomfortable position, but she obeyed how Kai wanted her to stay.

She stayed motionless, her brows furrowed in pain. Kai was using a [Heal] spell on her skin, making the marks disappear. It wasn’t just the surface, Kai was healing the fractured bones the woman had on her.

“Can you turn around?” Kai questioned.

Amyra simply withdrew her hand and turned around.

Kai could see the marks that spread from her neck that seemed to go below.

He placed his hand, hovering over her neck and started casting [Heal] spell again and again.

The mana started flowing out of him, powering up the spell structure instantly. He opened his eyes and continued to look at the injury that immediately started to disappear.

Since the injuries weren’t from corruption, it was just an easy display of magic. Claire had taken a look at them before and told Kai to get a Cleric to use herbal medicines, but he had plans to know more about her.

The problem with it is that she wouldn’t speak— not about herself, or where she’s from.

Kai glanced at her skin. His eyes went down from her neck before stopping as the glimpse of a blackened wrist caught his attention.

“Okay, it’s done. Can I see your wrist?” He asked.

The woman jumped back as Kai spoke, startled and hid her wrist.

She soon gathered herself and turned around, giving her hand to him.

Kai’s fingers wrapped around her wrist to see if there was any serious injury there. These were welts— angry red gashes that spoke of a harsh beating.

When he tried to turn her wrist over, she flinched slightly.

“I’m sorry… I will be more careful,” he said.

She looked at Kai with fear reflecting in her golden eyes. Kai looked at the wrist and started to push mana to heal her hand.

As his hands hovered over hers, he kept his eyes on her behaviour. He felt at ease seeing how she wasn’t struggling, unlike the first time when he tried to heal her.

Her eyes were just filled with a deep-seated fear of the magic he pulsated.

"Don't worry," he murmured, his voice a low rumble meant to soothe. It felt strange as he wasn't used to it, but he was getting better. "This will help with the pain."

His eyes went back to the wrists. A small glow emanated from his hands as he pushed in his mana.

Amyra sucked in a sharp breath.

Kai looked up to see her gaze flickering away from their hands and towards the wall where their shadows were plastered.

As the magic continued to work, Kai couldn’t help but try to make a small conversation with her. “Where are you from, Amyra?” he asked gently. “Is there someone who can help take you back home?”

Her golden eyes darted towards him, then back to the shadows. Her lips remained sealed and he knew that she had no intention of answering him.

Kai tried again. This time, he tried with a softer approach. “Do you have a home? Family?” he asked, looking at her with worried eyes.

Nothing. Just the faintest tremor in her shoulders.

She seemed uncomfortable with the questions.

Kai sighed as he worked on the last tendril of the healing spell. He finished it and withdrew his hand once he was satisfied.

“That’d be it for today. Your wrists should feel better now,” Kai said and stood up.

He saw how she tried to twist and turn her wrists. He turned around and started walking towards the door.

As he took a few steps, a faint murmur broke the silence.

“Thank you,” Amyra voiced out in a whisper.

Kai looked back for a brief moment and nodded at her, knowing that was all he’d get out of her for the time being.

***

The noon arrived sooner as Kai spent the morning healing Amyra. His usual routine was messed up as the priorities for the day changed.

He had already finished making the Heat stones batch for the week and was free from that work. Other work was handled by Francis and the man wanted Kai to rest since he had just come back from the expedition.

That's why, he headed to the library as soon as he walked out of Amyra's room.

Sitting there, his eyes were plastered on the book in his hand. His frown deepened as the musky scent of old pages filled his nostrils.

How come…

Kai’s hold tightened around the book.

It was a book of records related to the kingdom in the last few decades. It contained every major detail and events that had happened, and who had been significant during the time period.

For the past hour, he has been reading and trying to grasp the situation in his hand.

“Lord Arzan, this is what you asked,” Claire walked towards him with four books in her hand.

Yet again, they were all records he had requested, containing history from all over the world. They were all just to confirm his thoughts and what he had found so far.

“Thanks,” he took them from her and started shuffling through the pages, trying to find something— something!

His finger traced through the lines, reading everything that was written on the aged papers.

“What are you looking for, Lord Arzan? Anything else that I can help with?” Claire’s voice came in a whisper.

“No, this much should be enough,” he said, waving his hand.

Kai ran a hand over the worn spine of a leather-bound tome, its title obscured by swirling gold lettering.

Across the table, Claire meticulously traced a diagram with the tip of her finger, her brow furrowed in concentration.

As Kai didn’t need her assistance, she seemed to be doing her own thing in the library as usual.

Silence stretched between them, punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of floorboards and the howling wind outside the window.

Kai’s eyes traced after his fingers which went over names written on a list.

All these… They’re Mages.

Finally, Kai slammed the book shut with a sigh. He combed his hair in frustration as he looked at Claire.

She immediately stood straight.

"What is it, Lord Arzan?" Claire asked again, her gaze flickering up and looking towards the book he had been reading.

Kai tossed the book onto the table with a clatter. "This," he said, gesturing vaguely. The name of the book was “Men Who Changed History.”

“Everything is wrong with it.”

Kai clenched his fingers, a frown creasing his brow. He picked up a slimmer book, its cover adorned with a faded symbol that vaguely resembled a stylized eye. "I was looking into the most influential people of the past fifty years," he explained, flipping through the pages. “I noticed something strange in them."

"Strange how?" Claire leaned forward, her curiosity piqued.

“Most of them," Kai said, his voice low, “Most of them who shaped the world in the last half-century... they were all Mages."

Claire blinked. “Lord Arzan, isn't that common?” She asked as if she didn’t know anything better.

Kai shook his head, his frustration mounting. "Not necessarily. Mages are rare and powerful and they often dictate the world, but they are not the only ones. There's much more than just Mages in the world who could wield power."

In the book, there were nobles, kings, and researchers, but if they were Mages, they were referred to as one. Also, the list disregarded a lot of other people who could wield power.

It was human-centric and Kai had expected it, but it seemed like either Mages were too influential or the books he was reading were the wrong ones.

Kai thought for a moment. “Do you know any knights or warriors who could stand up to Mages?"

Claire's brow furrowed in thought. Her fingers, which had been tracing the diagram, stilled completely.

A long moment of silence stretched between them, only broken by the sound of a rat running through the floorboards in the back of the library.

Finally, she let out a frustrated puff of air.

"No," she said, shaking her head decisively. "Not that I'm aware of. From what I've always known, Mages are on a whole other level. Even the weakest ones could wipe out entire villages. Knights are well respected and they are known as protectors, but I have never heard of a knight defeating a Mage. It's like comparing a flickering candle to the midday sun. Mages are considered gifts from the gods, after all. Common humans just aren't built to withstand that kind of raw power."

Kai listened intently, his expression a mask of barely contained frustration. When she finished, he didn't speak for a beat, then let out a slow, deliberate exhale.

"Right," he finally conceded, nodding curtly. But then, something unexpected came out of his mouth. "And wrong," he added, the single word laced with a quiet determination.

Claire's eyes widened in surprise. "Right and wrong?" she echoed, a note of disbelief colouring her voice. "How can that be?"

A slow smile crept across Kai's face. He leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers in front of him.

"Let's just say," he began, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, "Every dominant force eventually faces competition. It might not be something anyone's aware of yet, but…" He trailed off, his gaze flickering towards the towering stacks of books lining the library walls.

Claire leaned forward, her curiosity piqued. "But what?" she pressed, unable to contain her eagerness.

Kai tapped his temple as a thoughtful expression masked it. He didn't answer her question directly.

He didn’t want to let Claire know everything because she wouldn’t be able to understand what he meant. He knew something she didn’t, but he would need more evidence before he could work on it.

Without another word, he rose abruptly from his chair. With newfound purpose, he began gathering a handful of books from the overflowing pile on the table.

"I'll figure it out first," he declared, his voice firm with conviction. “After that, I will show you what I mean.”

With that, Kai turned and strode out of the library, leaving Claire staring after him in confusion.

He was about to go to his room and start searching for what he wanted all over again.

As he closed the door after him, he tightened his grip on the books.

I hope I find what I want.

Jump straight to the first chapter Read





Killian knocked on the door and walked in when he heard a shout. He stopped as the scent of piped tobacco hit his nostrils.

"Killian! Good to see you," Francis's raspy voice boomed. He gestured towards a seat across from him, the worn wood groaning under Killian's weight as he settled in.

"Heard there's news from Malden?" Killian asked, his voice direct, cutting straight to the chase.

Francis straightened, a hint of pride flickering in his cloudy blue eyes.

He reached into the desk’s drawer and retrieved a sealed scroll, the red wax insignia bearing a sigil, often used by merchants.

"Just received this in the morning'," he announced, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. "Seems Malden took quite the shine to our little Heat stones."

He broke the seal with a practised flick of his wrist, carefully unfolding the parchment. His eyes scanned the contents, a low chuckle rumbling in his chest.

“I was waiting for you or Lord Arzan to walk in before opening it— here, have this tea.” Francis pushed the mug in front of him forward so Killian could reach it. “… Anyway, this says that he sold over half of them already.” His voice was thick with satisfaction. "And at a price even higher than we anticipated. Nobles are opening their chest for it and even commoners are trying to get it in their hands as soon as possible, so they don't mind paying more."

Killian's posture relaxed slightly. He expected good news, but it was even better than what he had assumed. Heat stones seemed to be an even bigger hit outside Veralt.

"That's good news, Francis," he said, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "Enough to settle our accounts?"

Francis chuckled again. He tapped the letter against the desk.

"Enough, and then some, Killian. By the time he returns, we'll be out from under the debt and with a tidy sum left over."

Relief washed over Killian. He felt his shoulders relax in the moment. Killian could easily say that it was the same for Francis.

Francis continued to read the parchment, a satisfied sigh escaping his lips.

A hearty laugh boomed through Francis' office as Killian slammed his mug of tea on the desk.

“Here, read the end of this letter. Noblemen requesting special Heat stones, carved all fancy-like for their posh homes? Now that's something I wouldn't have believed a month back!"

Francis, his face flushed with a mixture of amusement and pride said aloud.

Killian thought back to weeks back when Tradeheart merchant company had knocked on their doors, behaving badly and demanding they hand over their farmlands. He had seen no option, but for Lord Arzan to beg his brother for the sum.

Now, things have changed dramatically.

That’s something I barely expected.

"Indeed it has. Just a while back, the city felt like a ghost town, everyone holed up, fear gnawing at their insides." He swirled the amber liquid in his mug.

"But now," he continued, his voice dropping to a thoughtful murmur, "there's something different. The people are talking with so much hope! Even the guards… They were discussing how Lord Arzan defeated the necromancer. His reputation seemed to be increasing with them, especially because of the rewards he bestowed upon the fallen."

He fixed Francis with a steady gaze.

Francis started to talk, “Things are changing fast and for the good. A part of me believes it's just the start. After months, Lord Arzan had taken his duties as the lord and he seems to know what he's doing.”

“He's indeed very decisive about his decisions. That's a good sign of a lord.”

It was normal for Killian and Francis to discuss castle matters, and this time— they found a new subject that they couldn’t talk about in private for quite some time since Killian had been away for the expedition and Francis had been busy overlooking the distribution of the Heat stones in the city and the collecting herbs for soup.

Francis puffed out his chest. "Lord Arzan hasn’t always been a man of the people. But now, he sees the potential in things, and takes a chance." He tapped the letter from Malden significantly. "And look where it's gotten us. We might just take Veralt to another level, Killian. We might be able to make it a place we can be proud of, but there's one thing I can't put my finger on."

Killian raised an eyebrow. “What's that?”

“He's almost… like a different man entirely," he rumbled, his voice low.

The simple statement hung in the air.

Killian's brow furrowed, his eyes reflecting the same contemplative glint and he barely managed to stop himself from nodding.

Lord Arzan, the man they both knew, hadn’t always been like this, true. But lately, there was a spark in his eyes. His nature had changed for the better and he seemed to have a plan for everything.

A year back, Killian couldn't even rely on him to pull himself together. When they were coming to Veralt, he had been whining all the way and looked done with life.

Francis has a point.

"There's certainly something... different about him," Killian finally admitted, his voice barely a whisper. “He unlocked his potential as a Mage suddenly and maybe that's the reason. But the knowledge he has displayed is something I have never seen before."

Francis nodded slowly, his gaze fixed on Killian. "Yeah," he rumbled, his voice laced with a hint of unease. "A change like this... it can be a good thing, a leader stepping up in a time of crisis. But sometimes..." he trailed off, his voice fading into a thoughtful murmur.

"Sometimes," Killian finished for him, his voice grave, "change can be unpredictable. A good fire can bring warmth, but an untamed inferno can consume everything in its path. But… When it comes to Lord Arzan, I can’t pinpoint what has happened. Was he hiding his knowledge all this time?"

Francis shifted forward in his seat. “Do you think he could be…?”

Killian searched in his eyes for what he could be asking. But as soon as he realised what Francis meant, he scoffed. A snort escaped his lips.

"Shapeshifter? Weaver? Don't be ridiculous, Francis. You know he wouldn't go sniffing around Clerics if that were the case."

Francis grunted. "Yeah. But the change, Killian... it's undeniable." He paused as his eyes went to his fidgeting fingers. “Lord Arzan never cared for the common folk before. Now, he's all about hope, about rebuilding the city and the guards."

"True enough. Though, becoming a Mage can do that to a person. Gives you a new perspective, seeing the world from a different vantage point."

His words hung in the air, laced with a hollow echo of uncertainty.

They both knew it was a flimsy explanation, a mere attempt to rationalise the unexplainable shift in Lord Arzan’s behaviour.

"Maybe it's just... a coming-of-age sort of thing," Killian continued, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. Lord Arzan was young, yes, but having such a drastic personality shift to maturity felt like grasping at straws.

Francis looked at Killian curiously. “How was he before when you were a retainer at the Duke’s?”

“Well, the man practically was like a blood drinker, hating the sun. He stayed in the room, quietly. And to add on top of that, his brothers had quite a complicated relationship with him. The peak was during the succession. Things were bad then. Lord Arzan’s current personality… This is very different. Now that you asked about it, I doubt the coming-of-age thing matters."

Killian fell into a quiet thinking.

"There was a coldness to him then," he repeated once again, his voice low. "A distance, like he built walls around himself to keep everyone out."

Francis nodded slowly.

The image of the young Arzan, aloof and unapproachable, Killian remembered him clearly. He used to accompany Lord Arzan in a few of his outings and he was a quiet child who looked like he didn't want anything to do with nobles.

“I don’t understand-”

Before Francis could finish what he started to say, a sharp rap on the door startled them both. Killian rose and crossed the room, his hand instinctively reaching for the hilt of his dagger hidden beneath his doublet.

The door creaked open, revealing Lord Arzan on the threshold. A stack of leather-bound papers rested in his arms.

“What are you two talking about?” He asked.

Francis cleared his throat. "Lord Arzan," he greeted with a bow. "Just discussing... matters related to Malden and the Heat stones. They seem to be a hit with the nobles."

Killian, his brow furrowed, remained silent. Lord Arzan offered a curt nod, his expression unreadable.

"Good to hear," he replied, his voice devoid of its usual vibrancy. He strode into the room, his steps echoing in the sudden hush.

Setting the stack of papers with a decisive thud, his gaze locked onto the both of them as his eyes glinted.

"I’m glad I could find you both here. I have something that requires your immediate attention."

Killian and Francis exchanged a glance, a silent question hanging between them. The way Lord Arzan’s eyes glinted made Killian more curious.

"What is it, Lord Arzan?" Francis finally asked, his voice laced with a hint of trepidation.

Lord Arzan met their gaze, his expression turning serious. "It concerns Killian," he declared, his voice firm.

Killian's heart lurched. What could Lord Arzan possibly have to say about me?

Before Killian could voice his unease, Lord Arzan continued. "Specifically, his role as an Enforcer."

Killian exchanged a glance with Francis, wondering if he heard him. The administrator looked as confused as him.

"Enforcer?" he echoed, tilting his head in confusion. “What's that?”

"Killian," Lord Arzan began, his voice low and measured. "Do you know why only a select few individuals possess the ability to harness ambient mana and wield spells?"

"The three organs, my Lord," he explained, his voice steady despite the confusion that ran through him. "Heart, veins, and brain. Without all three functioning in perfect harmony, the ability to manipulate mana and cast spells is rendered impossible."

Francis gave a nod next to him.

Without the three organs, a human could never even think of manipulating mana. Although all of them could store mana, only the ones having the three organs could wield it as a weapon.

Killian had learned it very early on since he had been tested as a Mage as a child. The results were unsatisfactory and thinking back to it, his brows furrowed.

"Indeed," Lord Arzan said, breaking him out of his thoughts. "But what if the traditional understanding is... incomplete?"

A beat of silence followed.

"What… What does that mean?” Killian immediately questioned.

Lord Arzan's lips curved into a faint, enigmatic smile. "Perhaps," he replied, his voice laced with a hint of something strange that he couldn't pinpoint. "What if I told you that with two organs, specifically the heart and the mind, one can achieve a different kind of power?"

Killian and Francis once again locked eyes with each other.

“That’s useless, Lord Arzan. All three matters, and that has been the norm for ages,” Killian said and Francis nodded again in agreement.

He straightened, his gaze locking onto Killian with a decisive glint.

“I know that's what you have been taught, but it's not the case. A Mage needs three organs, but an Enforcer doesn't.”

“How does that even work?” Francis asked, looking like he was deliberating whether it was a prank.

“I will show it to you two,” Lord Arzan said. “Just understand, with the heart and mind— just with those two, one can leap beyond the constraints of mortals. An Enforcer can go beyond the natural strength a mortal can achieve and enforce his body with mana. Hence, the name.”

Killian’s frown deepened. He immediately felt his throat go dry.

That can’t be true, can it?

Kai’s eyes halted over Killian.

The latter’s curiosity was written all over his face. His eyes widened slightly, thinking about what just Kai said. His finger was tapping on his chin, thoughts written all over his face.

Kai gave a subtle smile.

“You must be wondering how it all happens.” He looked in between Killian and Francis. "Mana. Everyone has it. And everyone can absorb mana. I shouldn’t emphasise that even normal people can absorb mana, but only a few can use it for something greater. Do you really think only Mages can manipulate mana?”

“Yes,” Killian said. “If it were possible for others to do it, then Mages wouldn't have such privileges around the world.”

He shook his head. "Think of mana like a seed," Kai explained. “The Mana Heart is like the soil. It stores and provides the raw energy, the potential. The brain is like the gardener. It senses the mana, directs its flow, and shapes it into something useful. Grow the right crop. The mana veins are like irrigation channels. They carry the mana from the heart throughout the body, distributing it where needed, like to your palms where spells manifest.”

His fingers traced something in the air as lines appeared. It was an easy display of mana, one that made a diagram of a human in front of them.

Francis and Killian gasped at it.

“Now, if you have three of these, you are good to go. Unless there's something like a vein blockage or a defective heart, you would be able to become an able Mage.”

Kai paused, then drew a shape in the head, like a crude image of the brain. He connected it to the Mana Heart and left out the veins. “Now, there are cases where one has two organs out of the three. Out of a hundred people, one will have all three organs, but around ten will have at least two. If it's brain and heart, then they could be Enforcers. Obviously, there are uses if they have veins and a heart too, but it's not generally effective since sensing mana is important to do anything with it.”

“If there are no irrigation channels, how will it even work?” Killian asked, and Francis nodded in agreement.

“Not every crop or plant grows with irrigation, few grow under the soil, few don't even need water. The irrigation channels don't need to be present until the soil is apt and the gardener knows what to do with it,” Kai said, smiling. “In easy words, there's not one way to manipulate mana. Humans aren't meant to be rigid.”

“Lord Arzan, your words make sense, but if there's a way like that, then I don't know why no one knows about it,” Francis muttered. “Your words sound good as a theory, but I don't think it's practical enough.”

Kai clapped his hands together, knowing they understood what he was trying to explain. “It is practical. It's not about how much mana you have or whether you can use it like a Mage. It's about how the power inside you chooses to manifest."

“I'm sorry, but that sounds as plausible as finding a dragon's lair in the mountains," Killian grumbled, his voice rough and sceptical. He roughly raked a hand through his hair, looking at Kai with a confused expression plastered on his face. He blinked as he bit his lips and frowned. “I’m sorry for my words, Lord Arzan. What exactly are you talking about? Your words sound like something out of a dream and they… aren't real.”

Kai looked at Francis. He seemed to grasp some of what Kai explained, but Killian’s confusion was growing vividly.

It made sense since he had heard that Killian was a candidate to be a Mage, but had failed in the testing. Not being able to wield mana must have been a stinging wound for him.

Now, Kai was talking about how he could manipulate mana. If he was in his steps, he might have even lashed out.

Fortunately, he had a way to prove his words.

Kai grinned. "Have you ever heard of the Ashari Desert? A place where they say there's barely enough mana in the air for a Mage to come up? A literal wasteland."

Killian nodded slowly. “Yes, I have heard of the place. It's a place beyond Lancephil Kingdom. I have heard tales of it being a cursed land, ruled by the sand clans.”

“They don't have Mages. How do you think they protect themselves against the sand beasts?”

A glint flashed in Killian's eyes and he visibly struggled to put words out. Finally, he spoke. “They call themselves sand knights, right? I heard the story from one of my instructors. They use mana to strengthen their bones, some form of spells it is and gain supernatural strength.”

“Exactly,” Kai said. “But you are wrong. It's not spells. They don't call themselves Mages. Although a few of them might be Mages, they don't have enough mana in the air to do spells higher than 1st circle. So, they focus on their bodies and become Enforcers.”

In history, it wasn't known when the first Enforcer had emerged, but from what Kai had read, their techniques had always been there. Different clans in different parts of the world would hide them and won't reveal them to outsiders.

It was only by the end of the Golden Era of Magic that Enforcers became popular.

Originally, Kai had thought that Enforcers were always a part of society, but just became popular in the Golden era of magic. One reason was also that the records before it were hard to find. Even the ones dating back to the Golden Era were rare.

“Even if I agree with what you are saying, that sort of secret could change the whole world. I don't think clans from the Ashari desert would agree to hand over their techniques.” Killian frowned, glancing at Francis who seemed to be thinking of whatever he knew of the desert clans.

“We don't need them to hand over their techniques. I just used it as an example,” he said and looked at the arm of the knight.

Without a warning, Kai grasped Killian's battle-scarred hand with a surprisingly firm grip. "Relax, Killian," he murmured, his voice low. "Let me show you something."

“Yeah?” Killian relaxed under his orders.

A warmth flowed from Kai's palm into Killian's, a faint pulse of energy snaking up his arm. It was subtle, yet undeniable, like a heartbeat thrumming underneath the skin.

Killian stiffened, his gruff expression morphing into one of startled curiosity.

Kai released his hand, a satisfied smile playing on his lips. “I was checking your organs and you have got both. Heart and brain, I saw you sensing mana back when the merchant came to bother us and I wasn't wrong."

"Yes," Killian said slowly, rubbing his arm as if the warmth still lingered. His frown deepened, “My family paid for the testing when I was a child. A Mage looked for my organs and announced that I had two, but lacked veins to do magic properly. My family was disappointed and off to knighthood training I went after that, under the Duke."

His eyes clouded like he was back to a bad time in his life. Kai guessed that his childhood had been rough. It might just be his expectations of being a Mage or his family pushing him to be one due to the prestige. Probably the latter.

Kai nodded in understanding. “What if you have the power to defeat even a Mage inside of you?"

Killian snorted, the scepticism returning to his face. He shook his head immediately.

He doesn’t believe me… Yet. Well, time to prove it.

Kai turned his head around and saw the papers he brought with him. In a swift motion, he picked it up and handed one of them to Killian.

“Don’t dismiss me so quickly,” Kai said. His eyes were firm on Killian. “Read, learn, and then we’ll talk.”

Killian took the papers in his hand.

Kai looked between the duo and sat in a seat that was opposite Francis’s chair.

He saw Killian reading up what was on the paper with Francis craning his neck to take a peek at it. Time passed like that.

Each rustle of papers was punctuated by grunts of surprise, a deep frown etching itself between his eyebrows.

"Well, I'll be..." Killian muttered, tracing a finger over a crude diagram that seemed to chart invisible lines within a human form. "This... you're saying this is inside me? All this time?"

“Yes.” Kai nodded.

"It can't. It just can't!" His voice rose, tinged with a mix of awe and denial.

The room fell silent as he kept reading. Kai didn't argue.

He simply slid another page forward, a set of meticulously detailed exercises unlike anything seen in a book in the library.

Killian stared, the words blurring before his eyes. This wasn't about casting fireballs or weaving illusions. Because the pages were of different diagrams with careful instructions laid out to awaken as an Enforcer.

Kai slowly observed their expressions.

"I still don't..." Killian began, his voice thick with confusion, "How? How can this make me..."

Kai cut him off, "Awakened. That's the word. And if you do awaken as an Enforcer, you could take down that blasted necromancer on your own. Don't you want that kind of power?" His voice lowered. "To protect this city, to protect everyone. You are getting older and you know it. Your strength should serve you for ten more years before ageing will make you weaker. That's the natural process of a human, but with this, you would rise above it.”

A long silence fell over the table. Killian stared at the diagrams. Kai was trying to make him see the future with the diagrams and the promise of an Enforcer.

He was already too old to start as an Enforcer, but they had to take the risk.

Finally, Killian gave a slow, deliberate nod, his eyes still clouded as he held the papers, but that was enough for Kai who smiled.

***

They walked back to Kai’s room to begin the process. Killian sat cross-legged on the floor. Opposite him, Kai knelt, his eyes bearing on Killian.

He had dismissed Francis since he didn't want to be disturbed and the old man had promptly left.

Now, only the quiet rasp of Killian's breath and the soft glow of the candle filled the room.

The papers that Kai previously brought lay on his small study table. And the rest of the room was neatly cleaned.

"Alright, Killian," Kai began, his voice low and measured. "This is the first step. We need to awaken your Mana heart and then…" he paused, searching for the right words, "force it to push the mana beyond its natural limits."

Killian grunted. "Sounds simple enough." The gruffness in his voice seemed forced, laced with a hint of nervousness.

"It won't be," Kai countered gently. "Think of your Mana heart like a well. It collects energy from the air, but it's stagnant. Now, imagine…" he reached out, placing a hand on Killian's broad chest, directly over his heart, "Imagine me pouring water into that well."

He closed his eyes, focusing on the feeling.

"This is mana," Kai continued; his voice a steady guide. "I'm giving it to you, but you need to take control. Feel it flow, feel it fill the well. Now, picture it as swirling the water in the well. Don't worry about perfect circles, just…" Kai gestured with his other hand, tracing a loose, swirling pattern in the air, "Keep it moving, circulating the core."

Killian gritted his teeth, concentrating on the warmth spreading within him. Kai knew that he could almost feel a resistance, a pressure building as his heart neared capacity. But there was more to it.

He needed to let Killian know everything related to the awakening.

He briefly stopped pushing mana and kept his palm over Killian’s chest.

"You felt that?” he asked Killian who simply nodded. “The process will take longer than that, but it was just a small depiction of how it’d be. Now, you need to know that there are seven points," Kai explained, his fingers tapping specific locations on Killian's torso and limbs. "Vaults. They were always there but considered useless. Now, we believe if you can push the mana towards them and…" his voice trailed off, filled with cautious optimism.

"Open them," Killian rasped. "That's what you're saying, right? If I can force the mana to these… Vaults, that's the awakening?"

"Yes," Kai said, the single word heavy with anticipation. "It won't be easy. Without the natural channels Mages have, it's like forcing water through cracked rock. But if you can do it, Killian… if you can awaken those Vaults, you'll be something entirely new. Something stronger."

Silence descended again, broken only by the ragged rhythm of Killian's breathing. His eyes remained closed, his entire being focused on what Kai had told him.

Kai leaned closer, his eyes locked on Killian's. "This is important," he said, gravity heavy in his voice. "An Enforcer, it's... different from a Mage. They feel the world through their mana and amplify themselves with it. This awakening, if it works, will hurt. It will push you harder than any battle you've ever fought."

Kai pointed one by one at those key points on Killian's body— shoulder blades, both sides of the chest, wrists, a spot just above the navel. “It's a method of awakening that should be sufficient."

For the past few days, he had been busy looking through the records, trying to find one mention of Enforcers. When he found nothing, he had become sure that they weren't mainstream and even if there were Enforcers present, they were in clans that were closed off to the rest of the world.

So, he had thought back to his talks with Enforcers. He had a few of them in the Sorcerer's Tower and he had asked about their method of awakening.

After writing down everything he knew, he had made a whole process to awaken. There were a few gaps that he had filled with his knowledge of the human body and it wasn't foolproof, but it should be enough for Killian to awaken.

“Okay, I'm ready,” Killian said and Kai started the process.

The mana transfer wasn't a gentle trickle, but a forceful process. After Killian's agreement, he immediately started pushing mana through his palms.

Killian's body tensed, his muscles straining against the sudden influx.

Kai hadn’t gone through the pain personally, but he knew that it felt like a dam was about to burst within Killian, the pressure building behind his ribs, threatening to shatter bone.

Sweat beaded on his forehead.

The pain would increase as more mana got transferred and would reach its peak when he would try to move it around his body.

Then, Kai's touch lessened, the intense pressure easing slightly.

"Don't fight it," Kai said aloud; loud enough for Killian to nod briefly. "This is the first step. Your body isn't used to drawing in ambient mana, so I'm making it used to my mana." He paused, a hint of a chuckle in his voice. "Now, the real work begins."

He moved to push needles on different points of his body. They were there to make it easier for Killian to know where to push his mana. He groaned as the needles made their way inside his flesh, but it wasn't anything more than mild discomfort.

"Focus," Kai instructed, his tone suddenly sharp. "The needles— feel them. Each one represents a vault, a dormant point of power waiting to be awakened. There are seven of them. Find them. Move the mana into them."

If Kai was right, Killian would be sensing a glowing network of pathways, crisscrossing and branching to lead back to the vaults. Everything was linked together with each other. They were closed, but he would still be able to move his mana with enough force.

“Ah…” Killian gritted his teeth visibly. The crease in his forehead started pouring sweat buckets down his face. “I feel them,” he said.

Kai nodded. “Good.” He closed his eyes, knowing the real work was just about to begin. “Push the mana towards them.”

Kai started sending mana in waves. One after another, the intensity of the speed increased.

His voice crackled with urgency, “Don’t try to rush it. If you do, your body might break. In some cases, it might even explode. So, take breaths, feel my mana and slowly push it. Just remember the pain you will go through will be fleeting, but the power will be permanent."

He opened his eyes to look at Killian who was visibly struggling.

At this point, Killian was the one who had to be strong and resilient. Kai could send as much as mana that it would suck him dry, but if Killian isn’t willing to go through the pain to break what’s left for him to become an Enforcer, Kai’s attempts would be futile.

Killian frowned, squeezing his eyes shut. A strangled cry escaped his lips as Kai felt the latter’s muscles spasmed under his touch.

The way he shook his head aimlessly felt like he was about to give up. Kai’s palms continued his efforts as Killian clenched his fists.

"Don't stop!" Kai barked, his voice tight with a mixture of concern and determination. “If you do, all the efforts are for nought!"

Fueled by a primal instinct for survival and a flicker of defiance, Killian pushed again.

The pain intensified, a monstrous vice squeezing his chest, threatening to shatter his bones.

Like this, he might simply give up before awakening any vaults. He thought, staring at the knight's expression.

Kai quickly closed his eyes and focused on the mana that was rushing through his veins. He knew if he closely focused on the mana he released, he could feel where it was headed.

He then inhaled deeply, grabbed Killian's hands and pushed another wave. It went right inside Killian and started swirling inside his heart.

With the point of contact, he observed his insides.

Kai was aware of what Killian could see. He should be able to see the vaults now that his focus was heightened.

“Are the Vaults becoming clearer? Those small chambers in your body?” Kai asked, getting a nod from Killian in return. “Okay, I believe you are trying to rush mana in all of them. It won't work like that, so do it one by one.”

Killian’s grunts continued to fill the air.

With a final, desperate roar, Killian focused on the mana, pushing it down towards one vault.

A searing crack echoed in the room, and then… relief.

The vice loosened, the white-hot agony receding like a tide. In its wake, a warmth bloomed within Killian, a power thrumming beneath his skin.

Kai felt all of it.

Killian opened his eyes, blinking away the lingering afterimages of pain.

A relieved smile broke through the worry etched on Kai's face. He kept his palm on Killian’s body while trying to push mana to calm his racing heart.

"One down," he said, his voice gruff but lighter. "Six more to go. You feel it?” He asked in the heat of the moment.

“The unlocking— it took a lot of pain away, Lord Arzan. It was like… almost like a wave of pleasure. Should we continue?” he asked, breathlessly. His eyes brightened as he spoke.

Killian blinked as the sweat poured down his lashes before swiping it away.

“Yes, I can feel and sense what’s happening inside your body… It’s a part of the process. So don’t worry, we shouldn't rest until you have all of them unlocked.” Kai paused. ”Let’s continue now,” he said and closed his eyes.

The next hour stretched into an eternity.

Each time Killian focused on a new vault, the process repeated.

Agony, a blinding flash, then a surge of warmth as the vault yielded.

The second and third vaults were harder than the first ones.

By the end of the third one, Killian was panting. He was drained, his body a trembling mess. The room’s air was getting heavier as they both continued with the process.

The fourth and fifth vaults took more effort from them. Mostly, Kai. He had to drain himself while pushing enough mana for Killian to work on.

Killian remained unfazed by Kai’s doings.

‘One more to go,” Kai said while stretching his neck. His bones cracked under pressure, but seeing more vaults opening gave him ‘the go’ to continue with the awakening.

“I’m ready, Lord Arzan,” Killian said quickly.

In a heartbeat, Kai closed his eyes and focused on the mana swirling inside his Mana Heart. He started sending pulsating mana through his palms towards Killian.

Killian gasped as he realised how strong the last vault was. It was right above his navel, but the area surrounding it was tough to get through.

It was almost like attempting to breach a sealed vault with no keyhole in sight.

I have heard the last vault is the toughest one. Well, he should be able to push through it.

Without a word, Kai’s mana flowed through Killian’s body, trying to push through the final vault.

The sensations hit him left and right, almost as if he could open his body apart for how strong it was. A scream tore out of him as he pushed the mana, but the vault refused to budge.

Kai pushed in more of the mana, emptying his reserves and Killian kept at it, not giving up. Every second was daunting on his body and his shoulders were hunched from the weight of it. But as the final wave of pleasure washed over Killian, a sense of exhilaration coursed through him.

Kai opened his eyes. He looked at Killian and saw the shift in his aura.

He immediately felt… different. Stronger. He suddenly looked a bit taller and the aura he was giving was different than before.

It was sturdy, more powerful.

He looked up at Kai, a confidence in his gaze that wasn’t there before. "I… I did it," he rasped, his voice hoarse.

Before Kai could say anything, his face turned pale and he fell on his knees as his stomach grumbled. Something came up to his throat and he let it all out.

Kai quickly got out of the way.

Black liquid like the poison Kai had removed from his body gushed from his mouth, a stinking smell filling the entire room. He kept throwing up for a while before it stopped and dragged his body away from the pool of black liquid.

“What was that?” He looked at the liquid with a strained face.

“Impurities from your body,” he said. “That's normal with every awakening since Enforcers tend to cultivate their bodies, so the body repulses any sort of impurities that have been dormant.” Kai offered a weary yet proud smile as he explained. “Either way, congratulations. You opened the pathways."

Killian nodded, opening and closing his fist before sighing.

Just by the theories he knew of, Kai guessed that there would be a lingering pain, a dull ache reminding him of the whole ordeal.

But it should pass.

A laugh, tinged with disbelief, attracted his attention. "I haven't seen this clearly since I was a child," Killian said and took long breaths, the words coming out sharp.

Kai chuckled. “You will see better as you make progress. You don't know half the things an Enforcer can do."

Killian frowned, sharpening his confusion. "What do you mean?"

“You will learn with time. The power you have awakened, you are at the first step of it. Though, power without control is a recipe for disaster. We need to learn to harness this ability, to channel it into something useful."

Killian flexed his hand, awareness tingling in his fingertips. “How will I do that? More training?”

“Something similar. You can call it training, but the official name is cultivation."

Killian, still buzzing from the aftereffects of the awakening process, straightened his back. His eyebrows perked up in confusion. "Cultivation? What does that mean?"

"Each vault acts like a wellspring of power," Kai explained, his voice filled with quiet intensity. "By absorbing ambient mana from the environment and nurturing these vaults, you'll strengthen them, allowing you to access greater levels of power. Right now, you’re a First Stage Enforcer. A novice rank. You need to grow to truly show the full might of an Enforcer."

Killian frowned, a question gnawing at him. "Does that mean I can do certain things mentioned in the papers that I read before? Like, it feels unbelievable.”

Kai hesitated for a beat, a flicker of unease crossing his features. "That," he said, his voice carefully neutral, "is a matter for another time. Trust me, Killian, there's much you don't know. But for now, focus on cultivating your vaults."

He clapped Killian on the shoulder, the gesture oddly forced.

Killian nodded, looking at him before something came up to his eyes. “Wait, Lord Arzan. How did you even manage to know things in such detail? Where did you get such knowledge from?” He asked, his eyes glinting with curiosity.

Kai barely managed to stop himself from frowning. When he had talked about things before, he had simply said he had read about it. Even with the Heat stones, people believed he invented them.

Maybe they just thought of him as a talented Mage. After all, he was a Duke's son, but right now, what he had shown Killian and Francis was something that would change the world if it got out.

He couldn't just say he invented it because Killian was never going to fully believe it.

There was just so much he could pretend to invent when the previous Arzan was extremely different and hadn’t been a Mage for long. If he did, he was sure that Killian and Francis would simply think of him as an imposter which he was, but it might go the wrong way if they thought of him as a demon or a shapeshifter.

His identity wasn't a conversation he wanted to have right now.

With all that in mind, Kai replied, “I'm sorry, but I don't think I would be able to answer that. The knowledge didn't come from me. I did research about it, but the true origin of it is something I can't disclose right now. I could only assure you that it hadn't come from a sinful place and is meant to help you.”

“Why not?”

“It's not the right time. When it comes, I will tell you everything myself.”

The sincerity in Kai's voice, however faint, seemed to appease Killian for now as he nodded. His eyes clouded with an understanding.

"I believe you will. Anyway, this… feels very different,” Killian looked at his own body once again. A smile tugged on his lips as he forgot the matters they were discussing previously. “I think I need to clear my head for a bit. Everything feels overwhelming…” He looked at Kai with doubtful eyes. “I should go for a run, see how these new legs feel."

Kai smiled and pulled him up from the ground. "Be careful. Don't go using up all your newfound energy in one go."

“Yes, I hope I don’t get an injury. I don't think I will even if I crash into a wall. I will talk to you soon, Lord Arzan,” Killian said, reaching for the door.

Kai looked at him from behind, a sigh leaving his lips.

He felt his energy low. The awakening went better than he had expected— and it was all for good.

Although his first reservations about leading an awakening—especially with an Enforcer, considering his lack of experience—were evident, Kai had backup plans. Had the awakening failed, he had options ready that would have just made Killian uncomfortable for a day or two at most. To his relief, though, the process went off without a hitch.

But now—thinking of negative scenarios wouldn't do anything. Kai sighed in relief once again, this time, the stress he bottled up left his body.

It went well… And that’s all I could ask.

Gareth stood outside an inn and scraped the dust off his calloused hand, the grit clinging stubbornly beneath his fingernails.

He had helped transport a merchant's sandbags onto his carriage, which had stuck to him.

The job didn't pay anything, but it was a chance to make a connection. He hoped that the merchant would get him a job if he kept helping out.

Though, there was no guarantee. That's why he was here.

He took a deep breath, calming his nerves and looking over the board.

The Rusty Pickaxe Inn.

The once-proud image of a miner swinging a pickaxe that was the label of the inn was now faded and indistinct. According to what he knew, it was started by a former miner after he had accumulated enough money.

Hence, the name.

It also gave him hope that he might just be able to find a job here. Maybe by pity or by being in the same profession the owner of the inn used to be in.

He pushed open the creaking door as the scent of stale air washed him. He saw men sitting in the back, their faces filled with lines hunched over their mugs, their laughter filling the establishment.

More than half the seats were still empty. He guessed it was because it was still afternoon and because people didn't have coins to spare. Probably a mix of both.

A husky man with a greasy apron grunted in greeting, wiping down a glass with a dirty rag. He recognised him as Anson, the owner of the inn.

As he moved towards him, Anson asked. “Are you looking for lunch? We have some nice stew and boar meat today.”

“No,” Gareth rasped, his voice rough and nervous. He wiped his ragged shirt, trying to ease any wrinkles that showed. “I was hoping to find some work here if you have any. I don't mind anything,” he said, looking up at him.

Anson frowned, a flicker passing through his eyes. Gareth's heart fell as he realised he might be rejected, so he quickly continued.

“I- I used to be a miner. I can work hard for any job you may h-have,” he cleared his throat and stared at him.

Anson swept his gaze across the room, landing on the men huddled in corners. Their postures were slumped, talking about some girl who worked in a bakery.

It was a useful conversation and Gareth himself had been a part of a few of those when he was young.

“Work, eh?” Anson snorted. His voice almost sounded like rocks grinding together. “Half these lads here can’t cough up a copper for a drink. How do you think I would be able to pay to hire someone?” He jerked a thumb towards two men who were arguing over a chipped mug. “Those two fools haven't paid for half a year. Farms ain’t yielding much this year and the mines… They are captured and everyone involved with it is either dead, jobless or left the town.” He trailed off.

A bitter silence filled the space.

Gareth knew everything. He had suffered through it and was there when the bandits had captured the mine. He had barely escaped.

He looked back and forth between the rest of the men who hung out at the inn and the owner. He swallowed hard, forcing himself to stand tall.

He wanted to give up and return, but this could be his last chance to earn something for his family. He had responsibilities.

“I’m a strong worker.” His hands came and clutched together as they were shaking. His voice was steady. “I was one of the best with a pickaxe, I’ll do whatever it takes. I don't mind not getting any food until I'm paid. Even just the minimum is okay. I'm just very desperate for something.”

Anson dropped the dirty cloth that was in his hand and studied Gareth for a long moment, his eyes raking down the dust-caked torn clothes and worn boots.

He could sense the owner’s shift, maybe pity, maybe something else. But the good thing was that it was there. Though, only for a moment before it disappeared and Anson shook his head.

“Ya know, my son left for other places,” he said, shrugging his shoulders. “He was like you, a miner who lost his job. He helped out in the inn, but I barely had coins to run this place. So, he left, hoping for better opportunities. You can do that or…”

The miner inwardly sighed but listened. “Wait around in the city, go to everyone who might need help. The lord is already giving out food and I know the city would be swimming in dead bodies, if not for that. So, at least you won't die of hunger. Maybe, try out the guards. There's rumours the lord wants to recruit more people to protect the place, after the necromancer incident.”

“Yeah?” Gareth asked, his eyes widening at the mention of the guards.

“Yes, go and check with them. You might die out of cold either way. Why not die while fighting a monster? Makes for a good story,” Anson said and turned around, moving towards the back where Gareth saw glimpses of the kitchen. “Good luck, lad. Miners are tough. You will figure something out.”

A ghost of a smile touched his lips as he mumbled his thanks.

As he turned around and walked, the words of the owner still echoed through his mind. His jaw clenched tight for a moment.

Anson was right. Free food was the only thing that kept some semblance of life in this town. Being a guard— it wasn’t an ideal path, but at least it offered a chance for him to survive, and get a better life.

Gareth stepped out onto the dusty street, blinking against the coldness that swept through it.

Suddenly, a loud clatter shattered the tense quiet. People who were walking on the street turned towards the carriage that careened down.

A man seemed to sit on the back of it, dressed in a guard’s uniform and bellowed something unintelligible, his voice echoing through the buildings.

Gareth only got a look before he faded.

What's going on here?

He looked at the people who seemed to be talking in hushed tones before following the carriage. He didn't know what was going on, but it seemed to be important.

After all, he had never seen any guards coming on a carriage like this in the streets.

He quickened his pace, following the fading sound of the shouting man, drawn towards it like a moth to a flame.

As he ran, he realised the carriage was heading towards the public square and took to the alleys. The long narrow tunnels were perfect for him to cover long distances in a short time.

He kept his pace up and after a few turns, he found himself in a wide street.

The carriage was standing in the distance, right in front of the square and a large crowd seemed to have gathered up.

It was a crowd mixed with all sorts of people and even those who were inside their houses surged forward. A collective gasp escaped their lips as they all looked at the men on the carriage and what they were saying.

Gareth moved to stand at the end of the crowd, using his height to have a good view of the guard.

"Hear me, hear me!" the guard roared, his voice tinged with theatrical flourish. "By decree of Lord Arzan himself, a recruitment drive for the esteemed position of Special Guards commences this very week! You must have heard rumours… And folks, they’re right!"

A ripple of whispers ran through the people. They didn’t shout or show any emotions, but all of them seemed to be in doubt.

Gareth remained rooted to the spot, his brow furrowed in scepticism like the others. Special Guard? What kind of position was this? What was so special about guards?

The guard, oblivious to the confusion, continued his spiel, his voice going a notch higher.

"Work and train under the illustrious Knight Killian himself! Hone your skills, serve your lord, and earn a handsome wage— five gold coins a month! Register now!"

Five gold coins!

The words echoed in Gareth's mind. Another ripple went through the crowd as they whispered. A few people even rub their ears in case they heard wrong.

Five gold coins could buy a meal three times a day, a new pair of boots, clothes and after all that, they were enough to save a bit for the future.

Gareth couldn't help but imagine getting that much money every month. But reason quickly doused the embers of his optimism. He was a miner, his hands rough and calloused from years of wielding a pickaxe.

Combat? He knew the sting of a misplaced swing, the ache of exhaustion after a long shift, but the thrill of battle and fighting against someone?

A wry smile tugged at the corner of his lips. He wouldn't be winning any swordsmanship awards anytime soon.

He glanced around him, taking in the scene. Men, some younger, some older, all bore the same hopeful glint in their eyes. They surged forward, pushing and shoving, eager to be the first to register.

“Come forward! You, you and you!” The guard yelled once again. “You do not need prior combat knowledge to register! One can start without it if they fulfil the requirements!”

“What?! What sort of requirements are we on about?” An overweight man asked from the crowd.

The guard clicked his tongue. “You won't know yet. Lord Arzan will decide it personally. If you believe you have guts and potential, you will qualify. Remember, registration is free. There's no fee. If you believe you can do it, come forward and sign up.”

Gareth couldn't believe his ears for a second. If there was no combat experience required, maybe he could try?

He looked around himself and his heart fell once more.

The words from the guards had made even more people move to register, pushing and pulling each other to get to the front. Looking back, he saw even more men coming in.

The carriage had announced the opening of job recruitment in the whole city and it had attracted a lot of attention.

Seeing so many people, Gareth hesitated. Would he be able to compete with them? Doubt gnawed at him, a persistent voice whispering of failure.

Then, a memory surfaced, a warm hand calloused like his own resting on his shoulder. His father's voice echoed in his ears, "Whatever chances you don't take, son, some other guy takes it and hits it rich."

It was something his father used to say a lot. Over and over again. It was because he had lost out on an opportunity to apprentice under a merchant. After all, he had been too scared to go meet him.

Some other guy had and ten years later, his father was working in a mine owned by him.

His jaw clenched tight.

He may not be a knight, but he wasn't a coward either. He had gone down to iron mines and worked for hours every day. He didn't want that sort of life.

Five gold coins? Five gold coins were worth a shot at a better life.

Taking a deep breath, he calmed himself down. He had his wife at home. He needed to return with good news. If not that, then at least some hope of good news.

Gareth took a step forward, mingling with the men who wanted to take a chance— just like him.

“Come this way! Come in line!” The guard yelled. A few others moved to straighten the crowd in a line and to control anyone who was trying to break it.

He stood behind the line waiting for his turn patiently.

***

The tall man in front of him turned around. He recognized who he was– Old Man Clement, a man who lived on the same street as him.

He was kind and gentle and someone who always looked out for the people in the neighbourhood. But ever since the season Frosania started, things have been tough.

Along with everyone else in the city, Clement, too, could barely look after himself and his family. He had lost his job because his employer had left the city, and things had been rough from what he heard of his family.

When their eyes met, they exchanged a hesitant nod, a silent acknowledgement of their shared desperation and a glimmer of hope.

“Are you trying to get in with the guards too?” Clement questioned.

Gareth nodded. “Just like you. But, I thought you applied to work at the bar down the street,” he paused for a moment. “Unlike me, you know a variety of skills, so I thought you would be able to get a job quite easily.”

Clement sighed. He smacked his lips, “That place is dead. Been dead for months. The owner didn't have money to pay and as for my skills, no one thinks they are worthy enough to pay for it. Hence, I'm here.”

Gareth nodded as the line moved. He gave a slight pat on his back. “I hope the gods are looking upon you. Good luck.”

The latter smiled briefly. “You too. Good things are bound to happen. Especially with Lord Arzan distributing food to the needy… I believe something is about to change.”

Gareth could only nod to his words.

The line slowly snaked its way towards the training grounds, a large, dusty expanse where figures clad in gleaming armour sparred and practised formations.

Along with the people who were in the line, everyone seemed to be tense and nervous. Even the guards who were practising with their weapons seemed to hold a sense of tension in their shoulders.

I think that’s where the testing must be happening. He thought to himself as he looked at where they were headed.

Inside, a single room served as the testing ground.

Men entered, one by one, disappearing behind a thick curtain. A few emerged moments later, their faces etched with disappointment. Gareth's heart hammered a frantic rhythm against his ribs with each dejected figure.

Then, something strange happened.

A man entered the room, but unlike the others, he didn't come back out. Minutes stretched, a cold knot settling in his stomach.

Everyone waited and a few talked in hushed whispers. The guards called in other people meanwhile as the testing dragged on even if the man didn't come back.

After a brief twenty minutes, Clement walked out of the curtain with his lips pursed tightly, the old man didn’t even share a glance, but continued to walk away. He seemed disappointed and Gareth didn't have to think twice about the results. But now, it was his turn.

He took a deep breath, steeling himself for whatever awaited him on the other side of the curtain. Stepping inside, he found himself facing a richly furnished room.

Two figures stood before him— a stern-faced man in a crimson cloak which he identified as Lord Arzan and a knight clad in gleaming silver armour whom he knew as Knight Killian.

Lord Arzan's gaze was stern as he moved his eyes onto him while Knight Killian simply stood in the back, but the pressure coming off him daunted his shoulders.

Gareth's heart lurched. He bowed clumsily, his calloused hand brushing his thigh in a nervous gesture.

"Gareth of Veralt City," he stammered, his voice rough with disuse.

Lord Arzan gave him a curt nod. "At ease, Gareth." He gestured towards a wooden chair. "Please, sit."

He hesitated at the polite language, but with a murmured thanks, he lowered himself onto the edge, muscles bunched in anticipation.

Lord Arzan surprised him further by walking forward and placing a hand on each of his shoulders.

His touch was surprisingly warm. A strange sensation washed over him then, a tingling warmth that spread through his body like a wave.

It wasn't pain, exactly, but a prickling, buzzing sensation that made him want to twitch his limbs in protest. Yet, a strange calmness settled over him just as soon.

The feeling intensified for a moment, then receded as quickly as it came. Gareth blinked, his gaze darting between Lord Arzan and Knight Killian.

"What… what was that?" he managed to ask, his voice barely a whisper.

Lord Arzan's smile was both kind and knowing, he looked at the knight and then at Gareth. “The test and you should be happy to know that you passed," he said. "Welcome to the Special guards, Gareth!"

The recruitment continued for the next few days as Kai and Killian looked for more Enforcers. In the beginning, a steady stream of recruits lined up and walked through the makeshift processing area.

Killian ushered men forward; men who lived in the city and a few smaller areas outside the city. The result was unsurprising, some approached him with bravado, chests puffed out and muscles tensed. Others shuffled in nervously, their eyes avoiding eye contact with Killian.

He wanted to get as many men tested as possible, but it wasn’t possible with those who didn’t volunteer.

He also recruited ordinary men who didn't really have the necessary organs to become an Enforcer but were in good shape to replace the soldiers they had lost in the battle with the necromancer.

As the evening was approaching, Killian straightened his back.

Kai looked around and saw how the line had dwindled to a trickle.

The search for the Enforcers had been successful with them finding a few, but they hadn't found any Mages.

It was quite disappointing after going through all the people and testing if they had the necessary organs. But— it was understandable. Mages were usually rare by the numbers and in a city like this, there might be one or two.

Additionally, the mass migration that has been happening recently could be why they couldn’t find any Mages.

Either way, in the end, he got what he wanted.

He walked towards a man, one of the volunteers, who was seated with his hands on his legs. He was covered with dust and seemed as if he hadn’t had a proper meal in ages. His nervousness was clear as daylight as he fidgeted with his fingers.

Kai kept his palms over his shoulders and started pushing a very small amount of mana through, just enough to see if he had the necessary organs.

In a blink, he realised that the man was another regular volunteer. He didn’t have the necessary organs to become an Enforcer.

He shook his head and took a step back.

Killian walked up from behind and relayed the bad news to the man.

His eyes immediately fell to the floor as he stood up.

“T-thank you,” he mumbled disheartedly and walked back from the curtains.

Before the man could leave, Kai called out, “If you are from the nearby settlements around the city, wait till tomorrow and you should get the food when we distribute it.”

The man looked at Kai and nodded. “Thank you, Lord Arzan.”

Then, he disappeared beyond the curtains. As the curtains opened, Kai saw how there was no one left.

“That’s all of the volunteers who came forward, Lord Arzan,” Killian said as if he was reporting it to him.

Kai nodded.

He looked in between the people they had recruited. They stood outside the room, away from the gaze of the volunteers, but he could see them from where he was seated.

There were four Enforcers that they had gotten and all of them seemed like the perfect replacement for the fallen guards. At least in strength.

I expected another Enforcer or two, but there are four.

“Killian, ask them all to come in and see if Francis is free enough to join us too,” Kai said and waited for Killian to take action.

With a curt nod to Kai, he walked towards the four people who got selected. They were aimlessly standing by the side, sipping on the tea Kai had ordered to give them.

Kai sat back, while one leg rested over the other.

The men slowly walked inside the room, followed by Killian and Francis. As soon as they walked in, they bowed in respect. They didn’t utter a word until Kai spoke, but he observed them before the latter could speak.

Four men.

An eager-looking young man who was barely a teen, two miners who looked to be in their mid-twenties and one hunter who seemed to be in his late thirties.

All of them looked ordinary with blonde hair and patches of beard on their faces.

Out of all of them, only the young man looked frail. The rest of them had muscles and kept in shape compared to the ordinary man, possibly due to the nature of their jobs.

Kai nodded curtly. “Alright, you lot. Four of you—” he pointed at the men. “From tomorrow, you will be directly training under Knight Killian.” The men nodded excitedly. Their confused and nervous faces were no longer there, replaced with hopeful smiles. “Let's get acquainted. One by one, tell us who you are and why you decided to join. Be honest or there will be repercussions," Kai said, giving a warning in the end.

He didn't want anyone lying about their reasons to join when it was pretty clear.

A burly miner cleared his throat. He was easily the tallest among them, rivalling Killian. "Bord, Lord Arzan. As the mines shut down, figured this was better than nothing. No other job is willing to pay enough to survive." His voice rumbled, deep and gravelly.

The younger miner, wiping his hand on his trousers, piped up next. "Gareth, Your Lordship. Same as Bord. Just want to feed my family." He offered a shy smile but quickly stepped back.

The hunter, his gaze still flickering around the room, spoke next. “My name is Bran. I lost my hunting partner a few months back and it had been tough since then and the promise of earning good coin brought me here. Also, I was grateful to you."

“Grateful?”

“Yes, my child nearly died out of hunger a month back, but the soup you distributed saved her life. I wanted to repay you in some way and this seemed like a good opportunity.”

Kai smiled, finding no deceit in his words. “How's your child now?”

“She's healthy by the grace of gods.”

“Good.”

He turned towards the last man, prompting him to speak.

He was the teen who had been fidgeting nervously all this time. His thick eyebrows knitted together. “I-I’m Nelson. I was an apprentice cook but didn't like it too much. The pay was bad and I didn't have enough money to start my own restaurant, so when I heard about the announcement, I decided to try my luck.”

Kai nodded at each introduction, making a mental note of their names and demeanours.

"Good. You'll all find this life… different, but I assure you, it has its rewards. Your families will be moved to the guard quarters, with proper food and Heat stones. It'll be a far cry from living in your current home and struggling for food. Francis here will settle you all in." He looked towards him and he gave a confident nod.

A flicker of relief crossed Bord and Gareth's faces. Nelson seemed more contemplative, while Bran remained stoic.

"Now," Kai leaned forward, his voice dropping low, "There's more. We have plans for you all. Plans to give you abilities beyond the ken of ordinary men. The same power as Mages," he said, watching their eyes widen in surprise and wonder.

A murmur of questions rippled through the group. "Mages?" Bord rumbled, his brow furrowed. "But those are…"

"Rare," Bran finished for him, his voice laced with a hint of awe.

Kai held up a hand, silencing their questions. "I understand your confusion. Killian will brief you on the details later. But before we get to that, there's a crucial step. Enforcers, as you'll be called, typically undergo months of gruelling physical training before even attempting to awaken their vaults.”

He paused, letting the weight of his words sink in. "It's a delicate process. The human body can only withstand so much pressure. Many… don't survive the awakening."

A collective gasp escaped the recruits. The color drained from Gareth's face, while Bran's hand tightened around his other hand— knuckles whitening in the process. Even Nelson's eyes flickered with nervous energy.

"But don’t be scared," Kai continued; his voice firm yet reassuring. "That's where I come in. My methods are… different. With my help, you'll be ready to attempt the awakening in a month. A fraction of the usual time."

Kai saw how they were trying to grasp the situation. It was a given that they mostly didn’t understand what he was trying to explain. Especially knowing how Killian took time until the awakening to truly figure out what an Enforcer is.

He shot a pointed look at Killian, who simply shrugged. "Knight Killian here is already a walking testament to peak physical conditioning. You lot, however," his gaze swept across their faces, "have some work to do."

Bord and Gareth visibly gulped, while Nelson straightened his shoulder. Bran remained impassive, but a glint of something akin to hope flickered in his eyes.

“Enforcers? I have never heard the term before,” Bran asked.

Kai could tell they were still thinking about all the information that he lay in front of them. But well— it wasn’t time to go into depth.

“Yes, Enforcers. Once again, Knight Killian will be the one to explain who you truly are, and what your true potential is. So, be patient.”

Bran nodded, taking a small step back.

Bord cleared his throat. "So, when does this… training begin, Lord Arzan?"

Killian stepped forward. "Sunrise tomorrow," he announced. "The Lord himself will be joining us for the first session."

All the four faces flashed one look— surprised. Nelson faintly nodded, while Gareth’s frown deepened.

Kai smiled at them and gave a curt nod.

“Hope to see you all tomorrow. Get settled for the evening,” he said and walked out of the small room.

***

Killian bellowed, “Get ready!”

This was the first round they were about to run. Killian, who had already finished his morning workouts, urged the newly recruited guards. Kai also stood next to them.

“In three… Two… Run! Hurry!”

His commanding voice boomed throughout the ground.

Kai surged forward alongside Bord, Gareth, Nelson and Bran. They were right behind the guards who were normally training at this hour.

The morning cold wind hit Kai’s face. His feet fastened in an attempt to match the pace of the guards who were right in front of them— but the initial burst of enthusiasm quickly gave way to burning lungs and pounding in his heart.

His muscles started screaming in protest, and all the while the legs threatened to give up. But Kai didn’t want to be the first to falter. He gritted his teeth and pushed himself harder with each stride.

The run around the perimeter of the grounds was just the appetiser.

Kai’s muscle memory almost made him cast a spell, to ease the pain and accelerate the process. But he barely stopped himself from doing it.

His mind served him with more spells like [Soothe] and [Invigorate] but spells could be a double-edged sword in the long term, often leaving the user too reliant on them. Training his body naturally, however gruelling, was the safer, more sustainable option.

Arzan’s body needs to be more in shape and that’s what he should do.

And that’s what I will be doing… A little more.

As he successfully finished the third round, he looked at the trainees. The four men mirrored his expression.

For his enthusiasm, even they were going on for their reasons.

“Halt!” The fourth round came to a halt when they all jogged down and eased up their speed. Killian’s voice gathered all their attention. “Now, let’s get onto drills! Lord Arzan, you can begin the training regime we discussed yesterday!”

Kai nodded and started jogging to the side of the ground. He was panting, his heartbeat ready to thrum out of his body.

“Four of you! I will give you a drill to practise for seven sundowns! Get over here! Guards, you know what to do!”

Kai heard Killian’s voice from behind. He was hasting the process so that the exhaustion would take time to catch up after all the running.

Kai got to a place where he wouldn’t be disturbed by the guards’ training but also wasn’t too far from Killian. He started with the push-ups, pull-ups, lunges and a series of core exercises Killian had given him.

In a way, every workout was a struggle for him. His body wasn’t accustomed to such exertion, it started rebelling against his own will.

He continued his workout with heavy breaths but was conscious of his every move.

As he got to the core workouts, sweat started dripping from his eyes as if he was crying, stinging his vision. His muscles trembled and his lungs burned with every breath. But he had some more to go.

Two… Three… Four touchdowns.

The core workouts got harder every day as he increased the amount of each workout.

Nine… Ten… Done!

Kai sprawled on the ground as he finished his last exercise. He gasped for air, the sweat dripping from his face like a leaky faucet.

He got to his knees while his hands were on his thighs, trying to catch his breath. His eyes went across the field.

The enticing aroma filled the air. The maids handed over bowls of soup to all the guards. It was the soup that Kai had written the recipe for.

A soup made of herbs that would provide energy and warmth after exercise. A fairly common thing in his past life.

He saw Killian, his face etched with a rare seriousness, strode up to him. "Not bad, Lord Arzan," he rumbled, a hint of grudging respect in his voice. "I have to admit, I was surprised you kept up."

Kai managed a chuckle, though it came out more like a wheeze. "Just... building character, Killian. Nothing to it."

"Character, eh?" Killian snorted. "Well, you'll need plenty more of it in the coming weeks. But better than the first day," he conceded, "you did well."

Kai nodded, knowing he was telling the truth. "Now, about weapons training," Kai began, his voice surprisingly firm. "I'd like to start as soon as possible."

Killian studied him for a moment. Then, a slow smile spread across his face. "Alright, Lord Arzan," he said, his voice tinged with a hint of satisfaction. "Looks like I'll have the pleasure of personally training you with weapons."

It was visible that Killian was in a good mood after all the training. His energy was radiating after the awakening.

***

Kai was in his room.

Seated in his usual position on the ground, his eyes were closed.

He inhaled a good amount of mana, and let it flow inside his body. Intentionally, he let it circle his Mana Heart to a rhythm.

He counted the circles and started all over again, thinking of increasing the count gradually.

His thoughts started shifting from his Mana Heart to the problems that were in front of him.

It would take a few months before he could reach the next circle. With his physical training, he would be stronger. But it felt like an eternity, especially when there was Mage Actra.

For a few reasons, he wanted to deal with Actra faster. He didn't like the feeling of someone who could be dangerous to him living in the same place. But it isn’t possible. Kai mused and let out a frustrated sigh.

He needed more information to confirm his thoughts about Mage Actra. He needed proof of his wrongdoings. Most importantly, he needed to understand the extent of his power and the potential backing he might have.

Mages, as Kai knew, had a considerable amount of authority.

They were treated as chickens who lay golden eggs, and he was sure that Actra had backings that went far beyond the Duke. Even if he assumed he had tried to kill him due to his brother, an investigation would happen and he won't be able to get away.

So it made perfect sense for him to have more than one card to help him. But who?

Kai squeezed his eyes shut.

These questions would be unanswered for quite some time. The exhaustion of the day finally started catching up, a dull ache in his muscles, but his mind had restless energy.

He couldn’t do anything physically now, but—

He saw the worn leather-bound book— The Book on Golems.

Pulling it up again, he skimmed through the pages. He had already finished reading the book the night before. He had been reading it before bed every day while making his notes. It hasn’t been difficult as his interest in golems started increasing with every read.

His eyes fell on the notes that were inside the book.

Three parts. That’s what he understood.

The golem creation was divided into three parts. First came the vessel: sculpting a form from clay, stone, iron— any material capable of channelling mana. Next, shaping: meticulously crafting the wanted size and form, imbuing the vessel with the basic functions of movement. Finally, the most crucial step—the core.

The core was the golem's lifeblood, a receptacle for channelled mana mixed with monster parts, a miniature replica of a Mana Heart in some ways.

Just like potion brewing, it was an intricate art form, a dance between raw materials and the caster's intent. Higher-level golems, the book alluded to, could even be imbued with sentience, a feat far beyond Kai's current capabilities.

But well, I don’t want to give up. Maybe I could hunt monsters to find a few cores, later.

He reached for a small pouch that was tucked beneath his cot. It was the clay that he asked Claire to collect before.

He pulled it out from the pouch and kept it on the table.

The text’s descriptions were in his mind as if written in clear stone. He moulded the clay, imbuing it with basic principles of movement.

That’s what was mentioned.

His hands twisted and his palms grabbed the clay at different angles.

The next hour blurred.

At first, the clay was pliable, but with each try, the clay turned into something completely else. He used mana to hold it together, but his shaping skills were bad and the knight he was trying to make would instead look like a hybrid between a dog and a frog.

His magic wasn’t flowing the way he wanted, and even the notes he gathered started getting jumbled in the process of creating the mould.

Kai sighed.

Maybe if I just… The clay started melting into a pulp of nothingness. He was using the force of magic a bit stronger than he intended. Ugh. Why is it so hard?

It had been a month since the necromancer was killed. Kai, Killian and Francis were busy doing their own things.

Kai had conducted more trials. Not more for the general population, but for the guards they already had.

Each of them had undergone a test and the results had given them two more candidates to become Enforcers. One of them was named Henry, a guard Kai had never interacted with before and the second was someone familiar— Feroy.

He had already seen his capabilities in the battle against the necromancer, so it was a pleasant surprise.

Killian constantly had to make sure the guards were practising and continuing the training regime he had created for them. Even a day’s setback would make it harder for him to train the newly recruited Enforcers.

Even if two of them were trained to a certain degree, the others left a lot to be desired.

Francis was given a few jobs to take care of. He tried to take Kai’s suggestions and got himself busy with the food distribution. Kai knew that the small bowl of soup every person in the city received was not so small for them.

The men who walked in as volunteers for the recruitment constantly thanked Lord Arzan for giving them the food they received.

Kai’s heart warmed as they thanked him and explained how it helped their families survive. In the end, even though the food distribution was for the commoners to survive the winter and get his reputation to turn for the better, the feeling of doing good exceeded his expectations.

Apart from checking up and handling matters related to the food distribution, Francis had to keep an eye on Malden and the distribution of Heat stones.

The Heat stones were being distributed for different prices. The commoners received the Heat stones for a cheaper price, and it varied greatly for wealthy merchants and nobles.

The two latter consumers created profits for them to pay off the debts.

The recent news Malden brought was something that even Kai hadn’t expected. When Francis read what Malden had sent, his eyes widened with his mouth. He clutched the paper tightly and reread the same words he did before— aloud.

….a grateful noble family not only endorsed Heat stones but even coughed up 1,000 gold for personalised ones for the entire household.

Two weeks later, Malden sent another letter.

It wasn't a proclamation of another noble or merchant family endorsing the Heat stones, but news everyone was keenly waiting for.

We have gotten enough money to pay off the debt! Most of the Heat stones had been sold!

It was something that took something heavy off the back of Kai. A debt he had never taken, but had to pay off, but with the money collected from it, he could finally look forward to his plans.

***

The frosty morning wasn’t anything peaceful or silent for Kai. The clang of steel echoed through the yard and rang in his ears.

Kai gripped a practice spear that felt oddly comfortable in his hand and parried a blow from Killian’s blunted sword. Right now, they were in a practice spar.

Out of all the weapons he had to choose, Kai had decided on the spear. A sword or a rapier was okay, but a spear gave him the ability to put distance between his enemy and strike at the right time.

A major reason was also because it just felt right in his hands.

Kai felt sweat trickling down his forehead, but he shifted his focus to the attacks Killian launched.

The spear became a blur as he jabbed and thrust, mimicking the fighting style he learnt after spending hours examining how Killian showed it.

The latter mirrored Kai’s movements with practised ease. His sword deflected each of Kai’s attempts.

When Kai moved on his right side, Killian would quickly mirror it and avoid attack. And when he tried to change the direction of his strike, Killian would easily slide back and parry it, showing his mastery.

He would quickly adapt to Kai’s rookie movements and even try to attack Kai back using different small tricks.

The fight thus continued.

By the latter end of it, frustration started rising in Kai’s mind. His progress was showing, but Killian was on another level.

If he had used his spells, the fight would be over in an instant. But for their spars, he had refrained from it.

Internally, he cursed himself for never learning a few tricks for close combat.

“Argh!”

Taking a moment to think, Kai moved around his spear and aimed for his right shoulder, but twisted the spear to go for the left. It hit, momentarily distracting him.

He kept the momentum up and aimed at Killian's abs, but he feinted, taking control of the pace.

As Kai missed his next two strikes, Killian took that moment and capitalised on the opening, his sword flashing out in a deceptive arc that caught Kai’s spear shaft near the base.

Kai’s arm jolted back in pain, the spear clattering to the ground.

“Umph!” Kai grabbed the hilt of Killian’s sword. It was a desperate lunge to disarm him.

But it seemed Killian anticipated the move.

He smoothly twisted the sword and sent Kai sprawling backwards.

Kai landed hard, the wind momentarily knocking out of him.

Killian walked towards Kai and extended his hand. “Not bad, Lord Arzan.” The amusement was evident in his voice but tinged with a hint of respect. “Your spear work is definitely improving, but remember, a weapon is only an extension of the warrior. You also did well with lunging after losing your weapon. In a battle, that might be a desperate final attempt, but most warriors would die either way if they don't have their weapons.”

Kai grasped Killian’s hand and hauled himself to his feet. “Thanks,” he said in a shaky voice.

This was the third fight they’d been training and he was almost out of his breath. He had been learning well, but it wasn't at a level where he could use it in real combat.

He took a deep breath, trying to steady his ragged breathing before changing the subject. "How are the others?"

Killian grunted, remembering their state. "Recovering. Awakening's a harsh mistress. They all went through it yesterday, but the pressure…" He shook his head. "Even with your... assistance, it took a toll on them."

Kai winced. The awakening process was brutal. They had been training for over a month for it, but still, it had been too much for their bodies.

He couldn't help but feel a pang of worry for the new recruits.

He helped them to awaken yesterday but since the pressure was high, a lot of them passed out even though it was a success.

Killian chuckled. "Don't worry, Lord Arzan. They fainted, not crumbled to dust. They'll wake up with magical hangovers, but their dormant abilities are now awakened."

Kai nodded. “Yeah, I know. Train them well today, because there might be a test.”

He got to his feet and started shrugging off his clothes.

“What test?” Killian started by asking but a maid who came running abruptly halted their talk.

“Lord Arzan… Knight Killian…” The maid called them out. “Administrator Francis asked me to relay the message that Malden is in the castle, awaiting your presence.”

Killian’s eyes immediately came to Kai.

He nodded. “Let’s head down, then.” Kai stood up.

***

A wave of tiredness washed over Kai as he entered the room where Malden had settled. It was Francis’s office room and had enough space for everyone to sit and discuss.

Both Kai and Killian walked in as Francis and Malden bowed to him.

He stretched his arms over his head and started feeling his body move under pain. The training session with Killian had pushed him to his limits, and every muscle in his body ached.

Malden, however, looked like the picture of prosperity. Gone were the cheap, threadbare merchant clothes and furrowed brow; in their place, a well-tailored tunic and a gold chain gleamed around his neck.

Kai looked at his new appearance for a second as Malden sensed his presence.

"Lord Arzan!" Malden boomed, a jovial smile spreading across his face. "Come in, come in. You look like you could use a rest." He gestured towards a wooden chair.

Kai chuckled, collapsing into the chair with a sigh. "You could say that, Malden. Killian certainly put me through my paces."

"Ah, a training session with Knight Killian," Malden chuckled, his eyes twinkling as he glanced at Killian. Kai was sure that he had already gotten information about his training from Francis, but he still acted like he was hearing it for the first time. "Well, knowing how powerful you are as a Mage, I'm pretty sure some exercise would take your fighting prowess to the next level.”

“Enough about it,” Kai said, waving his hand. “Tell me everything about the sales. I can see you have greatly benefited from it.”

Malden tapped the golden chain around his neck with a sly grin. “It's all your grace, my lord. As for sales, I have prepared a note of every single transaction for you to check. I think you would be happy with what my small merchant company has achieved.”

“Let's see then.”

Malden slapped a thick ledger onto the table, the sound echoing in the room. "Over seventy percent of these transactions are for the 'improved' Heat stones we sold to nobles."

Kai opened the ledger, his eyes widening in surprise.

The nobles, it seemed, were easily fooled by size. They'd purchased the regular Heat stones, believing them to be a superior model simply because they were larger and more ornate.

Maybe they warmed the room a bit faster, but there was not a lot of difference between them and the regular model.

A pang of guilt flickered within him as he wondered how his master would have reacted to it, but it was quickly overshadowed by the sheer volume of gold amassed. 13,000 gold coins sat neatly documented in the ledger, way more than what he had predicted.

"You did well, Malden," Kai finally admitted, a hint of admiration in his voice. "This is a significant amount of coin."

Malden puffed out his chest, a prideful glint in his eyes. "Just doing my part, Lord Arzan. Just doing my part. And don't worry about a thing. I've kept meticulous records of every transaction, down to the last copper piece. Transparency is key, wouldn't you agree?"

Kai nodded, a genuine smile gracing his lips.

A glint of understanding passed between Kai and Francis as they made eye contact. Without a word, Kai’s lips curved into a sly smile. "Francis," he began, his voice low but firm, “Have you prepared what I requested a month ago?"

Francis, ever the stoic presence, inclined his head in a single, curt nod. A flicker of curiosity flickered in Killian's eyes, while Malden's brow furrowed in confusion.

"Excellent," Kai said, a hint of excitement lacing his tone. "Then Killian, gather a good number of guards. If any of the six are awake and coherent, bring them along too. We're going on an exercise."

Killian's confusion deepened, his gaze darting between Kai and Francis. "An exercise? What kind of exercise?"

Kai smiled. "Consider it a test. A test of both their abilities and ours. Details will have to wait until we arrive. Trust me, this little… excursion will be highly entertaining."

***

Within the opulent confines of the Tradeheart Merchant Company headquarters, Galvan, the silver-tongued merchant paced before a richly adorned desk, his voice laced with frustration.

Across the desk sat Erasmus Thorne, the head of Tradeheart. A man in his late fifties, Erasmus sat confidently. His sharp features were framed by a mane of iron-grey hair, and his cold blue eyes radiated a calculating glint. He was obese, and with his hands placed on the table, he gave off an aura of authority.

"Lord Arzan's return has thrown a wrench in our plans, wouldn't you say, sir?" Galvan pressed, his voice tight. "Public opinion has shifted dramatically. He's not just a scapegoat anymore; he's a hero who vanquished a necromancer and the messiah for the poor. Even his awakening as a Mage has deterred our plans greatly."

Erasmus scoffed; a dismissive sound that echoed in the opulent office. "A single victory does not erase his past failures, Galvan. The public is fickle. They'll forget his heroics soon enough, especially when the debts come due."

"But with the Heat stones…," Galvan began, his voice laced with concern. "They're generating a substantial income for the city. It's only a matter of time before they're able to pay us back."

Erasmus leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. A cruel smile played on his lips. "There will always be ways, Galvan. We just have to be… creative. Besides, the farmlands remain the key. Once we secure those, the city's financial future will be firmly in our grasp."

Galvan bit his lip, a flicker of unease crossing his features. While he had initially embraced the company's plan to exploit the city's desperation, Lord Arzan’s return and the recent events had sown seeds of doubt.

“I don't think you are—”

Knock! Knock!

Their conversation was abruptly interrupted by a knock on the ornately carved oak door. A young clerk, his face pale with apprehension, peeked into the room.

"Boss," he stammered, "there are… guards outside. A large contingent, led by Lord Arzan himself."

Erasmus's smile faltered for a brief moment, but he quickly regained his composure. Galvan looked as apprehended as him.

“What does he want?” Erasmus asked.

“I-I don't know.”

“Okay, show them in. I will meet them personally.” He frowned, giving a look to Galvan and closing his eyes. before leaning forward and adjusting the golden bracelet that was on his wrist.
