His eyebrows raised as he took the details. The entries were written in the elven language, but a few words didn't make sense to him. Either they were words he had never read or the ink had faded, making them completely different than intended.



Still, he was able to make up most of it, slowly going through a few entries.



The loneliness must be hard on her, confined to this chamber. I try to visit as often as possible, speaking to her in soothing tones, even though I doubt she truly understands. But perhaps, in her own primal way, she feels the care I put into her growth.



The entries, scrawled in a hurried hand, chronicled the observations of what he assumed to be a researcher— someone who referred to the monstrous queen with a disturbing tenderness.



He flipped the book around again and tried to see if there was any more information. The dust had clung to it and there were no handprints imprinted on it, meaning it wasn't used in a very long time.



He opened it again, skimming through different passages.



Well, well, it seems like whoever this guy was really into Sonia.



One passage gushed about the "adorable little darling" and how her "iridescent body already gleamed so beautifully, even at this small size." Another spoke of the researcher's hope that the queen, whom he endearingly called "Sonia," would grow up "big and strong, the prettiest queen this nest has ever seen!"



Kai winced. Pretty? Strong, sure, but pretty? The image of the monstrous queen he had just faced, its glistening maw dripping with caustic acid, flashed in his mind. He fought back a shudder.



The researcher then detailed his experiment.



The abundance of Atheum in this chamber was supposed to accelerate Sonia's growth. "With all this magical energy," the entry read, "she should be a real terror in no time! Can't wait to see how big you've gotten, my little queen. I know you must be lonely down there, but I'll be back soon to visit!"



Kai snorted. Lonely? The researcher clearly hadn't considered the other creatures dwelling in the nest – the very ones Sonia, in her ravenous hunger, would likely devour. The absurdity of it all, the bizarre affection for a monstrous creature, left Kai with a hollow feeling in his gut.



He clutched the book tighter, his initial urge to destroy the eggs momentarily forgotten.



This wasn't just about wiping out a potential threat now; it was about unravelling why the man had put the queen here and if the book wasn't touched for years, does that mean he was dead? Or had forgotten about the nest he created?



Kai tucked the book into his satchel, questions buzzing in his head.



He had a feeling this researcher, and whatever secrets this book held would be very interesting to go through. Going by how the man had planted the queen here, he was probably a Mage.



The book was more of a journal and he had only read a few like these before. Most of them he had found in ancient ruins.



He patted his bag again before moving carefully around the chamber.



Countless eggs aside, it was mostly empty. He searched for any secret opening, thinking maybe there could be more to this, but no.

Every corner was an unarguable ending. No dents, no hidden passages. Just the larvae eggs. He even thought maybe he could find something more about this absurd researcher— but there was nothing other than the journal.



Before leaving this hellhole, he had to finish his task.



His eyes went to the eggs that glistened, seemingly like they were staring at Kai, waiting to burst out of the shell and suck the little life out of him.

I need to burn these little bastards to the ground.



He raised his hand in the air. Only a small amount of mana was left in his very being, but he knew it would be enough for the eggs. They weren't known to be sturdy after all.



Kai unleashed a first circle [Burning Hands], bathing the chamber in cleansing fire.



The pulsating Atheum and the glistening eggs writhed as a large burning hand grasped them, their chitinous shells cracking and sizzling like bacon in a frying pan.



The stench of burning carapace filled the air.



You wouldn’t like what happened to your darling Sonia’s eggs. Kai scoffed at the absurd usage of names.



I hope I find something more than a disturbing lack of common sense in this journal by whoever the Mage researcher is.



He gave a final sigh at the burning eggs and quickly carried himself out from the same way he walked in.



***



Exhaustion hung heavy in the air as Kai emerged from the tunnels, his steps slow and measured.



An acrid tang of burnt chitin clung to his clothes and the memories of the battle clouded his mind for a brief second.



He had almost given up on defeating the queen for a while, but thankfully, he had managed. Way better than the last time with the necromancer at least.



He looked at the settlement that bustled with activity: guards who were less wounded, their faces drawn with fatigue, tended to the wounded, the green-tinged potions working their magic as expected.



"Killian," Kai said, his voice hoarse. “Give me a report on the deceased guards… And everything else”



Killian cleared his throat. "Yes, Lord Arzan. We lost eight good men," he began, his voice heavy. "A mix of Enforcers and mercenaries are injured. But they should be okay with proper tending once we’re back," He paused, then continued, "The life potions you provided were invaluable. They stabilized the worst of the injuries quickly, stopping them from getting worse even if they didn't heal them straight away."



Kai nodded slightly. The weight of eight deaths hung on his shoulders for some reason. "How many are left fit for duty?"



"Thirty-two," Killian replied promptly. "All Enforcers and the core of the mercenary group."



"Good," Kai said, a hint of satisfaction in his voice. "They'll need to carry the ones who can't walk back to the city." He looked around at the weary faces, then back at Killian. "Prepare a feast for them tonight, in the city. Let them celebrate their victory. Announce them as heroes, but hold off on any official pronouncements until after the funeral processions."



"Of course, Lord Arzan.” Killian nodded curtly.



Kai’s eyes then moved towards the men and Raven huddled in different places. The mercenaries were talking in hushed tones. Mostly, Finn was explaining something that happened inside with his arms in the air, making gestures to tell the events.



Gorak noticed Kai’s eyes on them and nodded. It was a brief, respectful nod. Kai returned it without a pause.



He was about to talk to Killian to start packing things to head back to the castle when his eyes landed on Actra.



His shoulders slumped, but feet hasty, he walked away, moving towards his horse, wanting to get out of the settlement now that the battle was over.

Kai let his frown linger for a few more minutes, seeing him completely disappear out of sight.



“All good, Lord Arzan?” Killian’s voice took him out of his thoughts.



Kai nodded. “Let’s head back. Pack everything.”



***

Two days bled into one another as he handled the aftermath of the battle.



After the funerals, a feast was prepared and although everyone enjoyed it, Kai knew that losing people in the mines and the faces of the larvae would haunt the guards for a while, as was the case after every battle.



Fortunately, it would fade and in a week or two, things would be completely back to normal— just as before.



Retrieval teams were sent the very next day and they hauled away the bloated corpses of fallen larvae, their chitinous shells still glistening an unnatural green as they carried them back.



Francis planned to sell them with Malden's distribution network. The merchant knew someone who had connections with the Alchemist guild in the capital.



After rounds of negotiations, the price of 300-500 gold coins per corpse was decided, depending on how good of a condition it was. As there were 45 of these corpses, they were going to make a hefty profit.



Though he had sold the corpses of common larvae, Kai had decided to hold off on the queen's corpse. Malden had been desperate, offering 5000 gold coins for it, but Kai had refused.



The greedy merchant had looked like he was even ready to take on debts for the corpse since it was so rare to come by and a few Mages and Alchemists would pay their entire savings on it.



But Kai restrained and put up a firm rejection.



He wanted to keep its outer shell and carapace as materials and its heart was something that would be perfect to build up as a golem core.



Francis, apart from handling business with Malden, set himself up to get the mines working back again now that they owned it entirely.



They weren't going to open up the nest area of the mine right away as they needed to clean it and do more inspections, but they could still mine out the iron.



Two days went by like that for Kai as he handled that with Francis, but on the third day, he walked towards a part of the estate he rarely visited.



Dust motes danced in the pale light that filtered through a grimy window as he reached a heavy oak door.



A lone guard stood before it. He seemed nervous, fidgeting his fingers and shifting from one foot to another. Kai could understand his position by his appearance— a young recruit, wide-eyed and fresh out of training.



The guard flinched as Kai stood there, not expecting to see him.



“I need to go inside. Step aside,” he said and the guard quickly got out of the way, not even daring to mutter a word.



He wondered why the guard was so scared, but he didn't care enough to ask and knocked on the door.



There was no response. He knocked again and it was the same.



A tense silence hung in the air, broken only by the ragged breaths of the young guard. When a few seconds passed by, Kai sighed and pushed the door open.



The room beyond was a stark contrast to the rest of the estate.



Sparsely furnished, it held a desk piled high with dusty tomes and scrolls. On the side, tons of plants were flowers stood right in front of a window through which sunlight rained over them.



Actra sat hunched over a desk, his face pale and drawn with a book in front.



He looked up as the door creaked open, his eyes widening in surprise as they met Kai's gaze. The book clattered to the floor, its contents spilling out. He didn’t bother to bend down to collect it.



Kai offered a weary smile. "Actra," he said, his voice gentle and calm. "Can we talk?"

53. Elephant in the room


A note from Extra26





What do you do when you are summoned to another world to stop the Demon King and your brother becomes the Demon King? Caught in a clash of spells between powerful entities, Aiden Lacheart suffers 'recommended' termination at the hands of the system and wakes up back in the beginning, on the day of his summoning..

This time he's determined to keep his brother from becoming the demon king.



* * *



But there's a problem. Aiden doesn't think he's the only one who's come back in time.

Chronicles of The Living Enchantment





Actra closed the book after picking it up on the floor and all this while— his eyes were on Kai. His hands moved with muscle memory, as he slid the book to the side.

“Please, do come in,” he said, in a flat voice.

He gestured vaguely towards a worn leather chair across from his desk.

Kai stepped deep into the room. Aged paper and an unusual odour filled his nostrils. It was the same scent he sensed whenever Actra was around.

His eyes didn’t leave the Mage as he took the seat. He let them drift casually towards the scattered scrolls and books, then at the cup of tea on the desk that had just been finished.

Smiling, he raised them and looked at the Mage.

“I’m sorry to bother you,” he said, trying to keep his voice fairly neutral. “Were you in between your research?”

“I was. As you know, you aren't a proper Mage if you find things easily when you are researching spells. Well, now that I think about it, you wouldn't know that saying since you haven't gone through formal training as a Mage,” he replied, not hiding the displeasure in his voice. “Is that the reason you are here? Wanting formal training from me—”

“No.” Kai shook his head.

Actra cleared his throat, coughing in the end due to his abrupt refusal. He straightened in his chair, “Then, I imagine you're here about the unfortunate casualties we suffered during the end of the expedition," he said, staring at him, trying to find something.

“No, that's not it either.”

Kai almost felt like he saw Actra frowning for a second before his expression turned normal. “I expected you to come to meet me and apologise for the behaviour of your knight and your words afterwards, but it seemed like you had forgotten respect after somehow stumbling upon your inheritance.”

It was the second time Actra had talked about it, but it seemed like he had connected his awakening as a Mage and spells to his family's inheritance.

It didn't make sense to Kai since Arzan had clearly lost the seat of Duke to his brother. Why would he get the inheritance?

Ignoring the questions, he frowned.

“I haven't forgotten respect. I only learned who to give it to.” Actra's face fell as he spoke. Since the man had brought it out, he might as well give it to him. “I’m very aware of the fact that you seem to not care about the lives of brave men who sacrificed everything for our safety. And that is something I can’t teach you, nor do I want to. It makes my blood boil. But much to my displeasure, I don’t have any jurisdiction to punish you for that.”

Kai paused. He waited until the Mage absorbed his carefully threaded words.

"However," Kai continued— a hint of amusement creeping into his voice. “I had a few questions. I wanted the answers from you.”

“Do ask, Arzan. You’ve all the rights to do so.”

“How about we start from the time you started to serve me?”

A snort escaped Actra’s mouth as he shook his head. “I’m not serving you. I’m not bound to. My service is loyal to your father for the time being, who put you out here. Respectfully, to answer your question, I don’t even serve him as it's a temporary service. I’m still a Mage of the Archine Tower.”

Kai nodded. His mind shifted to one thing he said. The Archine Tower. He had read about it, but he refused to show anything— his neutral face that he always presented to Actra apart from times he angered him to the core on display.

“If that’s the case,” Kai’s voice was gentle, slow and thoughtful, “under whose orders did you try to kill me with a silly ritual? Was it my father or the Archine Tower?”

Actra's gaze sharpened. This was it. The conversation they had both been dancing around for the longest time, the elephant in the dusty, book-filled room.

"My loyalty has never been in question, Lord Arzan," Actra said, something unusual shimmering in his voice. "The ritual was… necessary." He stressed the word, probably hoping it would ring true. “It was necessary for you to awaken as a Mage. Isn't that what we both wanted?"

Kai's gaze held a steely glint. "Do you truly believe that, Actra? Or are you simply clinging to that narrative?"

Actra faltered at the accusations. “Why won’t I? You asked for it yourself; you wanted that ritual to escape your mortal shell, finally getting a chance to become a Mage.”

"Why won't you tell me the truth? We both know the ritual wasn't for that," Kai pressed, his voice low and intense. "Are you not curious how I actually became a Mage? Or are you content to keep living this… ruse? I thought you would be curious to know how I lived through your trap."

Actra looked like a cornered animal, his gaze darting around the room before landing back on Kai.

The question hung heavy in the air. He knew he was playing with fire when it came to confronting Actra, but he didn’t want to delay it anymore.

He had already gotten glimpses of his powers back in the cave and although he might have a few tricks he didn't know of, Kai had no qualms about dealing with him. Even if the fire burned, he was going to extinguish it today.

Finally, after a few seconds, Actra swallowed hard, a desperate glint flickering in his eyes.

"I did it for you, Arzan," he croaked, his voice barely a whisper. "For your own good. The ritual… it unlocked your potential. You might think otherwise, but you were only able to be a Mage because of me being loyal to you."

Kai leaned back in his chair, a hint of a no-nonsense smile playing on his lips. "Loyalty, is it? That's a curious way to describe telling me to stab myself in the guise of a ritual for a measly ten thousand gold."

Actra flinched at the mention of the sum. "It was a rare ritual," he said defensively. “Blood and soul rituals are like that. They need a little sacrifice. You see, it produced results!"

Kai sighed a weary sound that echoed in the dusty room. He felt like a man navigating a minefield, each step fraught with the potential for detonation. "Indeed," he said, his voice low. "And I imagine it took considerable effort to acquire such a potent ritual."

Actra straightened slightly. "Yes, It wasn't easy."

"Easy enough to plot with the Tradeheart Merchant Company to saddle me with debt, I presume— probably me losing my territory in the end, was the goal?" Kai asked, his voice devoid of emotion.

Actra's bravado sputtered. "That's a bold claim, Lord Arzan," he stammered, a nervous twitch developing at the corner of his eye.

Kai didn't reply.

Instead, he reached under his robe and placed a stack of papers in front of Actra.

He frowned, not knowing what they were.

Kai pushed it forward so that Actra could take a proper glance at them and soon he saw how Actra’s gaze flickered between the pages and Kai.

They were the records of his communication with the Tradeheart company. He was sure most of them had been destroyed, but their main agreement was intact where Actra had been given more than a few rare resources in exchange for making sure that Kai gets in the position of needing a lot of money.

It wasn't a bad plan.

Actra uses Arzan's desire to become a Mage to sell him a rare ritual which would kill him. At the same time, contacting Tradeheart who had been eyeing the farmlands and getting resources from them in exchange for creating an opportunity for them to saddle him with debt.

He had even gotten away with the gold coins Arzan had used to get the ritual from him.

It was a win-win situation.

Kai hadn't found any agreement in the Tradeheart office, meaning they had destroyed it. Fortunately, Actra hadn't bothered to, probably never thinking about a possibility where his plot would be revealed. A rookie mistake.

Also, there were also letters exchanged with the Archine Tower, and the notes where it was mentioned that they were keeping a close eye on him— another thing for him to be concerned about.

For a moment, silence reigned supreme, broken only by Actra's ragged breaths. He stared at the documents, his face a mask of conflicting emotions— shock, anger, and a simmering fear.

"How… how did you get these?" he finally croaked, his voice hoarse with disbelief.

Kai's reply was a chilling smile. "A simple perusal of your belongings while you were… away. You do remember I'm the lord of the place and my reputation among the maids who clean the rooms is pretty good these days. A simple order is what it took."

Realization dawned on Actra, his features contorting in fury. “You went through the wards I made!" he roared, his voice laced with a desperate edge.

“They were easy enough to dispel," Kai said nonchalantly.

The box containing the documents he had been given by the maid was warded, but an hour of deconstructing the spells was enough to open them.

Actra lunged forward, a torrent of accusations spilling from his lips. "Who are you? Arzan could never learn to dispel my wards in a million years. You are an impostor?!"

Kai met his gaze unflinchingly. "Who I am is irrelevant," he said, his voice low and dangerous. "But what is relevant is that you'll answer for your crimes."

A flicker sparked in Actra's eyes as he raised his head, trying to build up a spell structure. Mana surged around him, but suddenly his eyes narrowed.

He lowered his raised hand. “You… What did you do to me?!”

“Nothing.”

“Why can't I call up my mana?” He screamed, his eyes boring daggers at Kai.

“I really wondered how you survived being a Mage for so long. You shouldn't just drink anything. Though, I guess your senses aren't strong enough to sense Mana Bane,” he said, his eyes moving towards the cup of tea. “Well, it was a very small portion of it and simply meant to render you useless. Your veins would be blocked for a few hours, but it would return to normal soon enough. By then, you would be in the cells.”

Actra smashed his hand onto the teacup as Kai finished his explanation. For a second, it felt like he was going to overturn the desk as various emotions flashed through his eyes.

But out of nowhere, he pulled out a small vial with a few drops of black liquid inside.

Without wasting a single second, Actra drank it up and threw the vial on the floor.

“What's that? An antidote? It would take a while to—”

Kai stopped mid-sentence as he noticed something strange. A vicious smile suddenly appeared on Actra's face as his body started to warp.

A strange surge of mana erupted out of him and he clearly felt it. It was extremely different from the usual mana Actra used and was a bit murkier. It was also familiar to Kai.

“Dead mana…”

His eyes widened as black spots appeared on Actra's arms and his eyes turned red, the vicious smile stretching more and more.

“I told you before Arzan. You should have respected me more before.”

* * *





Gone was the unassuming Mage, replaced by a horrifying monstrosity.

Kai's blood ran cold as leathery wings erupted from Actra's back, a sickening blend of membranous flesh and chitinous spikes. Razor-sharp claws replaced his fingernails, and his eyes glowed a malevolent red, the crimson hue reflecting a chilling awareness.

Panic threatened to consume Kai, everything he thought he knew about Actra shattered in an instant.

This wasn't a desperate Mage lashing out, this looked like a predator, a terrifying fusion of weaver and bloodsucker.

A rough snarl ripped from Actra's throat— sounding oddly like a mana fiend's voice.

The air crackled with mana, the effects of Mana Bane extinguished by the raw power that seemed to course through Actra.

Spiked stones materialized from the very air, propelled by a surge of magic, hurtling towards Kai. He sidestepped them with inhuman agility, the projectiles shattering against the wall with a deafening crash.

With a swift movement, Actra lept at Kai, their bodies colliding in a burst of raw power. In the heat of the moment, Kai looked at Actra’s rageful eyes as they beamed with something else— something he had never seen before.

The impact sent them crashing through the dusty window, their fight spilling out onto the estate grounds.

They were suddenly hurtling through the air.

Actra twisted in mid-air, his monstrous form aiming to slam Kai into the unforgiving earth.

With a desperate surge of adrenaline, Kai reacted on instinct. He twisted away from the impending impact, his hand snapping forward as he channelled his mana.

A blazing bolt of fire erupted from his palm, aimed directly at the leathery wings. The sound felt like the air splitting as the fire met flesh.

The impact threw both of them off course, their intertwined bodies crashing towards the training grounds below in a tangled mess of limbs and fury.

A few people scrambled with shrieks, terrified of the monster’s appearance. Kai looked up to see Francis walking towards the ground with a few people following behind. They seemed to have seen the monster flying around and looked shell shocked.

Actra, a monstrous parody of his former self, shrieked in fury, its wings caught in fire. Kai, barely registering the guards scattering in terror, scrambled to his feet.

Out of nowhere, Killian appeared at his side, his eyebrows furrowed.

Kai looked down at his body immediately, seeing the bruises and cuts where Actra had grabbed him with his claws.

He got to his feet, though a sharp pain through his knee nearly made him fall again.

"What's happening?" Killian asked, holding up his sword. His loud voice echoed through the grounds that were suddenly in complete silence.

"No time to explain!" Kai roared, hurling a searing bolt of fire towards the monster.

Actra, wings beating furiously, twisted in mid-air, the flames licking harmlessly against the rapidly growing scales that now covered his forearms. He launched himself at Kai with a guttural snarl, a horrifying blend of a bloodsucker's rasp and a fiend's hungry roar.

Dark vines, thick and menacing, erupted from the ground like black serpents, coiling towards Kai with unnatural speed. What the fuck-

"Actra? Is that Actra?" Killian's voice cracked with disbelief as he lunged forward, his sword flashing in the sunlight. Steel met writhing vines in a shower of sparks and severed tendrils. But for every vine he cut down, two more seemed to rise.

Kai, caught in a whirlwind of thrashing vines and snapping jaws, desperately launched another volley of fire.

The flames momentarily singed the leathery wings, but the monstrous hybrid pressed its attack. With a powerful kick, Actra sent Kai rocketing towards the makeshift weapon stand on the ground.

Kai slammed into it with a grunt, the air momentarily knocked from his lungs.

He scrambled to his feet, a throbbing pain radiating from his hip where he saw a dagger plunged. Taking it out, he frowned and looked around.

Spotting a discarded spear lying nearby, he snatched it up, its smooth surface slick.

Actra, a monstrous whirlwind of fury, swooped down before him. Claws raked at the air, inches from Kai's face, the stench of decay and blood washing over him.

Kai ducked it and jabbed the spear forward, hoping to land a lucky strike, but Actra twisted with unnatural agility, the tip of the spear whistling harmlessly past.

This wasn't the Actra he knew or had seen firsthand.

This monstrosity was a blur of fangs and claws, screaming a terrifying power.

Kai gritted his teeth. Actra's mana surged, the telltale signs of a 4th circle Mage radiating from the creature. Actra was previously just a 3rd circle mage, but now, it was hard to tell if he would be able to stand against him for long.

Focusing, Kai formed a spell structure of a second circle spell [Wind Blade] and unleashed it at Actra who hacked down at him with his claws. The blade of wind hit its sides, but the monster's smile simply grew as if he was relishing the pain.

Kai quickly rolled on the ground to dodge the attack and just then, Killian rushed from behind, his sword flashing under the sun in a desperate attempt to flank the creature.

But even with their combined efforts, they were barely holding their own.

A swipe of Actra's claws left a bloody gash on Kai's arm as he barely sidestepped the attack. The pain shot through his entire being, his feet turning cold for a second.

Killian, attempting a daring manoeuvre, managed to land a glancing blow on Actra's shoulder.

The creature shrieked in fury, the sound laced with a hint of surprise. But the injury was superficial, quickly eclipsed by a surge of dark energy. Chunks of earth suddenly erupted out of the ground, turning into sharp stones and rained down on Killian.

He reacted with impressive reflexes, deflecting some with his blades, but one caught him squarely on the chest, sending him sprawling to the ground.

A cruel smile, a grotesque mockery of Actra's former features, twisted the monstrosity's face as he turned towards Kai.

"This will be a spectacle for the ages," he boomed, his voice echoing across the ground. "The hero of the territory who's slowly rising up in the eyes of his people slain right in front of their eyes. Won't that be such a spectacle? People shall see, Arzan! People shall see!"

Actra lunged, his leathery wings propelling him through the air with inhuman speed.

Kai, with a rush of adrenaline in his body formed various spell structures around him. He was bloodied and battered, but as Actra came close, he only saw a coldness in his eyes.

Out of the spell structures, razor-sharp blades of air materialized.

As Actra descended upon him, Kai lashed out, aiming the wind blades not at the creature itself, but at the thick, leathery wings.

The blades trailed through the air as Actra spun to dodge two of them, but the third one struck true, tearing a gaping hole in one wing.

Actra shrieked, thrown off course by the sudden rip.

Before his body could crash on the ground, Kai aimed bolts of fire at him, but suddenly, Actra let out a loud scream. The dark energy around him condensed as vines came out to block the bolts.

Kai pushed more mana to form another spell structure, this time of a 3rd circle spell, but the vines made way for Actra who emerged with rageful, bulging eyes.

Immediately, he broke the spell structure, knowing he had no time to complete it and leapt to the side, but Actra grabbed him at an unprecedented speed.

Then, he leapt up holding Kai, rising high in the sky as the voices of Francis and others faded with each passing second.

“You are truly not Arzan. He could have never survived even a minute against me in this state. I would love to dissect everything out of you after I take out a limb or two,” Actra crackled with laughter, looking close to a villain from a theatre play.

“A dead man can't do that,” Kai replied, struggling through his grip, but unable to even budge it. Wind rustled past his neck as Actra flew towards the center of the city.

“Let’s see who will be dead. You are simply a weakling who barely could stand against my noble strength.”

“Noble? That's a funny way of calling an ugly creature that even your own mother would loath!”

“You!” Actra shouted, his face scrunching up in a scowl and for the briefest moment, he paused, probably wondering how he was going to torture him later on.

That gave Kai enough time to build up a spell structure in a matter of less than a second.

A fire bolt flew out, hitting Actra right below his neck, making him take a wrong turn.

Kai seized the opportunity, using the momentum to propel himself upwards and get out of his grip. He landed with a roll on the slanted roof of an inn, the bustling market sprawling below him.

All of them had seen the monster flying around with Kai and looked pale, as if they had seen a ghost.

Kai ignored them, quickly making a run on the roof.

But Actra was upon him in a heartbeat.

Claws lashed out, tearing through the clay tiles of the roof.

Kai barely dodged, rolling to the other side of the peak. The struggle continued as they attacked and dodged each other at the rooftop. Finally, with a deafening crash, the roof gave way under their combined weight, sending them both plummeting towards the cobblestone street below.

Shrieks of terror filled the air as people scattered, desperately fleeing the path of the falling figures.

Kai braced himself for impact, but just before they hit the ground. They landed in a heap on the bustling marketplace, sending a wave of frightened onlookers tumbling back.

Actra paused for a split second, his crimson eyes boring into Kai. "Why?" he rasped, the question laced with disbelief. "You see the power I wield, the strength coursing through me. Why do you persist? Why not make this easier for both of us?"

Kai’s eyes met with Actra's gaze unflinchingly. A guttural snarl ripped from his throat, a sound devoid of fear. "I've faced worse abominations than you," he growled, his voice raw with exertion. "Creatures that would make you cower in your borrowed power."

Actra recoiled, a flicker of shock momentarily extinguishing the crimson glow in his eyes. It was as if he was trying to find any deceit in his words.

But it was fleeting. In its place, a renewed surge of rage flared.

He rushed in again, swinging a claw at Kai who rolled to the side, mentally thanking Killian for all the training he had put him through or the claw would have ripped apart his heart.

In a blink of a second, another claw came for him, but sensing it, Kai hit back with a bolt, momentarily halting it. That gave him enough time to put distance between them, but he knew it was futile.

At first, he had assumed the transformation was short since Actra's body wouldn't be able to handle so much power for a prolonged period of time, but now, looking at his bloodshot eyes, he knew the old Mage was ready to keep it up until he killed Kai.

A part of his being was terrified as Actra opened up his mouth to snarl and rushed at Kai, but it wasn't the first time he was in a battle.

If he had to die, it was never going to be in the hands of someone like Actra.

“You are going to die at my hands, you insolent brat!” Dark energy swivelled around him as he flung, swinging his wings, but Kai kept standing, anger flaring at him as he sensed the scent of foul, dead mana coming at him.

He reached deep within himself, knowing the exact spell that was going to get him out of this predicament. In an instant, four spell structures formed in front of him, taking in the form of glyphs.

“Astrum Laxme Endro Fiend!”

Every word he took, more pressure dawned upon him until he felt like every part of the body was pierced by sharp rocks, but as he completed the incantation, the glyphs flared to life.

Blood leaked out of his nostrils and Kai felt like he was barely managing to stand. Despite that, a smile formed on his lips.

The glyphs mixed into one and Actra's eyes widened as he paused his charge.

"How?" he stammered. "How can you wield such power? Your mana…"

Kai cut him off with a snarl. "I don’t have to answer a dead man."

With that, white-hot flames flared up to life, engulfing everything around them and heading straight towards Actra.

As he felt the power coming from the mystical flames, Actra retreated, fear clear on his face.

The flames pressed onwards, leaving a trail of charred ground whenever they went.

Actra, for the first time in the fight, was on the defensive, his monstrous facade crumbling under the might of the flames. They struck his body, burning his whole hand as he tried to leapt back, but the more he struggled, the more the flames chased him as if they had the sole goal of burning his entire soul. He only protected himself with vines emerging from the ground, forming a barrier around him, but the flames burned them at a rapid pace. He frowned, looking down at his bloodied left arm. The flames had burned away three of his fingers and the pain was excruciating. If they touched him again, he knew he was dead.

Driven by desperation, Actra lashed out with a volley of jagged stones, ripped from the very cobblestones beneath their feet.

They didn't move towards the flames, but Kai who was standing right behind them.

The projectiles rained down on him, each strike leaving a fresh gash on his already bloodied form. A pained grunt escaped Kai's lips, but he pressed on.

Actra, his crimson eyes gleaming with sadistic glee, threw his head back and let out a chilling laugh. "You see, Arzan? Even with your fancy tricks, your power wanes! You'll burn yourself out before I'm finished with you!"

Kai ignored the taunt, focusing on channelling the remaining mana.

The [Fiendfire] spell was a hungry beast, draining his reserves at an alarming rate.

With a final surge of will, the white flames flared up, severing the thick vines in a matter of seconds that protected Actra.

Knowing his tricks won't work anymore, Actra flapped his wings, aiming to fly away to protect himself, but Kai couldn't let it be.

The flames chased after him, but Kai knew they would die before reaching him, so he thought of another spell. Maybe the last spell he might be able to do and even then, he would be borrowing strength from his life force.

Despite the risk, letting Actra go was the worst thing after all this trouble.

So, he channelled mana around his hands as all his energy seeped away into the spell, but he didn't care.

In a heartbeat, he cast [Infernal Chains].

Out of nowhere, dark, flaming chains erupted out of the ground, heading towards Actra who had already reached quite far away, but they bound themselves at his legs, yanking him down as he screamed.

He tried to move, swinging his claws at the chains.

"You think these pathetic chains can hold me?" he asked, loudly. The voice blended with monstrous noises filled the air. "You can clearly not hold yourself together. Once I'm free, your secrets will be mine! I'll tear every one from your lips, even if I have to rip your very soul from your body!"

Kai ignored the threats and moved forward towards him, one of his hands moving towards one of the inner pockets of his robe.

Actra, consumed by his rage, didn't seem to notice something far more dangerous than fear in Kai's eyes as he continued to taunt him while trying to get out of the chains.

“Have you given up?” Actra’s voice came after noticing how silent Kai had gone. Kai smirked. Without the flame, his spells would barely scratch Actra's body and he didn’t have enough mana to keep up with the chains for long.

"You're a fool, Actra," Kai rasped, his voice hoarse. "You have no idea what you've just done. Dead mana isn't a thing to play around even if I have no idea how it managed to transform you to such an extent."

His hand came forward, powering up the chains with the last remaining mana so that the fire would burn him up. Actra opened his mouth to let out a monstrous shriek but Kai lunged himself forward.

He tipped the vial and poured the shimmering liquid down the hybrid’s throat.

Actra's eyes widened in horror as the potion coursed through his veins.

By the look of his eyes, it was clear that the monster realised what was happening to him. Kai gave a final smile that was too cruel to his liking and ran away from the chains, as far away as he could.

He had taken around thirty wide steps when a horrifying sound burst from behind.

The force of the explosion made the ground beneath them shake, the shockwave rippling through the marketplace, shattering windows and sending dust flying.

Kai, his ears ringing, scrambled to his feet and took cover behind a sturdy stone wall just as the marketplace erupted in chaos.

The detonation was deafening as flesh and blood rained on the ground.

Kai leaned against the stone wall, his ragged breaths blending into his environment. The marketplace was buzzing with the energy of the aftermath of his fight with the hybrid Actra turned to.



But his mind wasn’t on the destruction of the chaos.



It was on a fundamental lesson from his childhood— a foundational truth about mana, the lifeblood of magic. Different types of mana, like volatile chemicals, could have a dangerous result when mixed.



Actra's veins were blocked due to the venom in the tea and even if he had managed to dispel the venom, it was still in his body. Despite that, he went ahead and drank the potent potion that made him turn into the monster he was.



The mana in the venom and the dead mana from the vial already made him unstable.



The final stroke was Kai’s healing draught he carried with him and never used, hoping for an opportunity like this.



It had been the spark for a reaction. The potion's simmering energy and the dark mana coursing through his veins turned Actra into a bomb. Both of them had clashed together.



And then… He had turned into nothing. Just a plume of dust settling over a scene of devastation.



Relief washed over Kai, a wave so potent it almost eclipsed the throbbing pain radiating from his side.



Actra was gone, reduced to a crimson mist scattered on the wind.



He looked down at his own blood-stained clothes. He was cut and bruised in different places and almost lost his limbs due to that bastard’s claws.



He sighed, trying his best to ignore the pain that came from different places in his body. Even breathing at the moment was hard.



A flicker of movement caught his eye. Killian, his feet hasty was rushing towards him with guards and Enforcers behind him.



Even Francis, his usual stoicism replaced by a furrowed brow, was perched awkwardly on the back of a large white draft horse.



Beyond them, curious townsfolk peeked from behind shattered windows and doorways, their expressions a mix of fear and morbid curiosity.



Kai forced a smile, a grimace that pulled at his already stinging wounds. "Looks like things got a little out of control," he rasped, his voice hoarse.



The words felt hollow on his tongue, a poor attempt at levity in the face of the devastation.



Killian reached his side, kneeling on the cobblestones. "Lord Arzan, are you alright?” He extended his hand and saw Francis rushing forward with a potion.



Kai looked around at the ruined marketplace, the injured civilians, and the faces etched with fear and confusion. He knew a simple explanation wouldn't suffice.



He didn’t say anything, but grabbed the vial and chugged it down. The cool liquid soothed the raw scrape on his throat. He winced as he felt the potion seeking the ache inside his body.



“Was that a monster? Was it Actra?” Killian’s questions came next.



Kai sighed, the memory of the monster coming back at him like a storm.



He nodded at his questions, exhaustion dragging at his eyelids. "Clean up the city," he murmured, his voice barely a whisper. "Help the injured… and for now… I just want to rest." He closed his eyes, the world fading into a welcome oblivion.



***

Twelve hours later, consciousness returned to Kai in slow increments.



The throbbing pain in his side had dulled to a manageable ache, replaced by a comforting warmth that spoke of healing draughts at work.



His body ached, but it was a familiar ache, the kind that came with pushing himself to the limit and not the agonizing pain of Actra’s attacks.



After he woke up, Francis gave him the whole account of what had happened when he was unconscious.

News of the explosion had spread like wildfire through the city.



Rumours swirled like smoke, people talking about the monstrous creature terrorising the marketplace before being vanquished by Lord Arzan.



Francis had swiftly moved to quell the more outlandish rumours, assuring the public that the threat had been neutralized.



They had searched the area where the battle had taken place, but other than blood and body matter, nothing had survived.



The first order of business, once Kai was deemed well enough, was a thorough examination of Actra's room.



Kai himself, though still a little weak, participated in the search.



They found everything one would expect from a Mage's quarters— shelves laden with spellbooks, a meticulously tended herb garden, and a few artefacts and certificates with the insignia of the Archine Tower attached to them.



Actra, it seemed, had been an orphan with no known family ties. At least it seemed to be since there was no proof of him sending anything to anyone.



Knowing his personality, Kai wasn't opposed to the idea that he had simply broken off contact with his family after becoming a Mage or had just forgotten them.



Even his communication with the Duke, Kai's father, amounted to a single introductory letter and a formal confirmation of his role as Kai's retainer.



There were some items of interest— a hefty pouch of gold coins, a collection of expensive garments. But it was on the second day, amidst a pile of discarded robes, that Kai found something truly unexpected— a card. Tucked into a hidden pocket, it was almost overlooked.



He flipped it over.



On the front, a simple inscription greeted him: "Thank you for your business." Below it, an image of a skeletal dragon was drawn. The craftsmanship was at a high level, meaning whatever organisation it belonged to, it wasn't poor.



He called for Killian and Francis once the whole room was checked twice and the only thing of interest they found was the card.



Entering the meeting room, they looked at him with concern in their eyes, but before they could ask about his health, he cut to the chase.



"Have either of you ever seen this?" he asked, holding out the card. “Or know where it is from?”



They examined it in turn, their brows furrowing in confusion. “No, I have not," Killian said, shaking his head.



“Same with me. It seems to be some organisation's card, but I haven't seen anything like it before.” Francis gave the card back to Kai who leaned against his seat and sighed.



“It was the only thing worthy of note in Actra's room. It might be the key to finding out how he turned into that creature,” Kai said, giving the card another look.



The skeleton dragon stared back at him.



“It’s certainly strange. I thought I had seen a lot when we fought against the necromancer, but I never imagined there would be weavers with wings in the world. And M— I mean Actra would be one of them,” Killian muttered, looking a bit shaken.



He had fought Actra briefly and hadn't been able to hold on for five minutes against him. It seemed to have hurt his pride since he had been making great progress as an Enforcer.



“He wasn't a weaver,” Kai corrected him. “It was more of a hybrid. If I had to give him a name, he was more like a bloodsucker. They normally have wings and red eyes, but they look way more heinous than he did.”



“Bloodsucker?” Francis' voice echoed in the room. “Can they shapeshift into humans?”



“Yes, some can. They can look very convincing even, but Actra wasn't one. He used some potion to shift into one. It was a temporary transformation, but I don't know how. It shouldn't be possible in my opinion, but I guess it is now. We won't know anything until we investigate further.”



He felt depressed that he hadn't managed to salvage the body or part of the potion he had used. He had searched the room, hoping for a sample, but was disappointed.



For now, his only clue was the card.



“Francis,” Kai said, forcing himself to focus. “Talk to Malden and see if he can get any information on this card.”



Another thing he had realised lately was that he had very limited ways to access information about the current world. He had been holed up in Veralt and the rest of his territory since he had become Arzan.



Even if he had solved a few problems, he hadn't gotten time to gather together an information network.



Till he did that, Malden was his best bet. The merchant was greedy, but he doubted he was the type to not follow his orders, at least until he believed that Kai could lead him to more profits.





“Yes, Lord Arzan, I will notify Malden about it right away,” Francis said, nodding his head. Then, with a hint of hesitation, he spoke up. "Lord Arzan, there's the matter of… Actra's demise. Since he was affiliated with the Archine Tower, we need to send an official report detailing the incident and the cause of death as per protocol."



Kai grimaced. The Archine Tower was a big mystery for him though he had heard about the name and a few things.



From his research about them, he knew they were the premier institution for magic in the whole Lancephil Kingdom, situated in the centre of the capital. Alongside being the most powerful organisation in the country, it was also a big political force.



Like every Mage in the kingdom, Actra also had ties with them and was only serving his father due to the kingdom policy of a Mage serving one noble for at least two years as a retainer.



Actra's letter with them hinted that they were aware of his awakening as a Mage and someone in the Tower had called for his death. But for what reason? He had no idea.



Originally, he suspected that Actra worked for his brother, but that was clearly a wrong line of thinking.



Why someone in the Archine Tower is after Arzan? He doesn't seem to have any secrets. Or am I just wrong?



He wondered but got nowhere.



Raising his head, he looked at Francis. “Do we have to do that?”



“Yes, Lord Arzan. Every Mage is a resource and Archine Tower takes the death of each of them very seriously.”



“I wonder how they would take the death of a Mage who attacked a noble and turned into a monstrous abomination,” Kai said and shook his head.



“Okay, send the report. Let's see what comes out of it.”



He forced a smile, but it felt hollow. The reason why someone wanted to kill Arzan, the Archine Tower, the card— they were all pieces of a puzzle he didn't understand.



He knew until he solved these mysteries, they were going to bother him at the back of his mind.



For now, he could simply wait until the right time came for him to know more about the person whose body he was inhabiting.



***



Later that night, after ensuring that everything else was on track, Kai retreated to his room.



He settled into a meditative pose, focusing his remaining mana. He could feel it, a tremor at the edge of his perception, the barrier between his current circle and the next.



The fight with Actra had taken a lot out of him, but after almost a day of rest, he had recovered. His body's recovering ability had gotten even better in this era since there was abundant mana for his mana heart to absorb.



His battle had also made him realise the need to break into the next circle as soon as possible. He had somehow managed to deal with the larvae queen and Actra, but if there was a whole Mage Tower after him, then he would need all the strength he could gather.



That's why, he took in all the mana from his surroundings, focusing on building up the next circle.



He knew he was close to progressing. Slowly, the mana circulation in his heart grew in power and got brighter and brighter as he sucked more and more mana, making it his own and trying to grow his reserves.



It was working and it was extremely close. Few more circulation and stabilising and he would break through.



He felt a surge of power, and...



A dull ache throbbed behind his eyes, and Kai reluctantly opened them. He hadn't broken through. Frustration gnawed at him, but he pushed it away.



After the recent events, he was better off focusing on the bright sides. A small smile tugged at the edges of his lips.



The barrier was thinner, and with a little more focus, and a little more time, he would surely break through.



The speed boost he'd receive would be invaluable, especially considering the unknown threats he now faced.



Maybe just a week more.



Needing a distraction, Kai turned his attention to the book retrieved from the larvae nest.



It was a worn leather-bound tome, filled with spidery handwriting and crude sketches of grotesque creatures. As he delved deeper, he felt his limbs go cold at what he read.



My experiments with the larvae resulted in me getting Sonia, but she's not the one I'm looking for. She's cute and would be very strong, but what I need is something else. Her ability of mana control would make her a good leader, but she's still an ordinary monster. With a stone in my heart, I had to get her a new home, like my other babies.



“So, are there more creatures like the larvae queen?” Kai muttered, hoping the man hadn't put more such creatures in his territory.



He flipped a page and kept reading.



Aside from the larvae, the spiders, orcs, goblins and similar land creatures have simply died in my experiments. Those who survived, I have grown as my babies, but I'm not getting what I'm looking for. Maybe I should move towards sea creatures? They have their own secrets and the merfolks might be of help. Or I should search for the lost city of the sky? I might be able to find extinct creatures there. Someone, someone who can survive and become the “perfect being” I'm looking for.



Aside from descriptions about monsters, there were also detailed methods of cultivating them as well as the small experiments the man had done with them.



But Kai skimmed through those parts.



His sole focus was on the main goal of the man which was apparently to build a “perfect creature”. He had no idea what it entailed. Was it about unparalleled strength or just the most balanced monster? One thing was clear— the man he was reading about was crazy.



As he read more, his eyes suddenly stopped at a page.



Even a wyvern hasn't survived dead mana. I thought due to their strong cores, a bit of dead mana wouldn't do anything, but it has started corrupting John. Its screams and painful cries are making me hurt and there's no way to continue the experiment. Maybe only dragons could survive dead mana, but even I, Hendricks Klandel, the legendary beast tamer only regard them as myths. Where would I even find them?



More and more questions erupted in Kai's mind as he read. Hendricks Klandel? He hadn't heard of him before and he was a legendary beast tamer. The thing that attracted his attention the most was the part about dead mana.



He was experimenting with it, trying to see what creatures could survive the corruption.



His fingers trailed through those lines and as he turned the page, they stopped in their tracks.



If I didn't do anything fast, the prophecy would come to be. The world would succumb to dead mana and it would be the rise ---



The page was incomplete, torn in half by someone and Kai's eyes widened as he finished reading it.



“Prophecy?” He muttered, but no one answered him in his room.

56. Volume 1 Epilogue


A note from Extra26





"It is said he arrived in fire and rain".



* * *



Ramor-Tai monastery is a haven of the Wasteland - the place where heroic Cultivators can hone their skills through meditation and martial tournaments. For decades this place has stood as a bastion of humanity against the storms of war that threaten to engulf what remains of the world, though the Disciples of each Sect have agreed to a strict pact of non-interference with worldly affairs.

So when a man made of steel comes to knock at their doors one morning, he is met with shock and suspicion.

Jade-skinned beauties? Godlike powers? The ability to command the heavens themselves? These common dreams were not the desires of the machine-man. All he cared about was learning, understanding, and harnessing his Qi. All he wanted was an answer to the question: "Do I have a soul?"

His name was XJ-V. This is the tale of his legend.



* * *



Welcome to Cog Cultivator - the only Xianxia with a robot MC

Link: Cog Cultivator (Xianxia)





A damp chill prickled through layers of thick hide, pulling a groan from deep within the cave.

The groan echoed through the cave.

Numerous eyes, crimson and flecked with gold, cracked open, revealing completely dark pupils that seemed to devour the faint light flickering through the entrance.

It scanned the surroundings, taking the familiar stalactites and the dust motes that danced in the stale air. It inhaled subtly, not wanting the dust to crowd its senses, and noticed the mana— everywhere.

Then, a tremor ran through its massive form. The prickling sensation that wasn’t pain but an unfamiliar pull towards… West.

Grrah!

An animalistic noise left its mouth as the sensation resonated in the very core of its being, pushing against years of slumber.

A flicker of an image, a flash of fire, and panicked human figures sparked in its mind. The vision of the settlement lingered a bit longer. The red eye narrowed.

More and more visions passed through its mind and something in its head prompted him to move towards the west, to the settlement. It was a command worthy of its stature and its calling.

A low growl rumbled through the cave, vibrating the very stones. Shadows stirred in the depths, responding with guttural rasps.

They were smaller versions of the behemoth, scaled creatures with razor-sharp teeth and eyes that glowed like polished obsidian. They were its children, the ones it had birthed to spread the message of its rule.

The massive head lowered, its voice reaching every little one as they looked at him with a deep hunger imitating the behemoth’s. "The slumber has been long," it rumbled. "But the gnawing hunger for dominance, it never fades. If anything, I feel more hungry! More powerful than before, ready to devour everything. A new power calls for us to rise and take our rightful place.”

The smaller creatures stirred, a collective snarl erupting from their throats. They understood. They craved the taste of fear, the power that came from absolute terror.

A cruel smile, if a creature like this could be said to smile, stretched across the towering face. "Go then," it boomed. "Prepare the world for our arrival. Let them know the name of true terror again. Especially the humans."

A wave of excitement rippled through the chamber. Snarls turned into excited yips, clawed feet drumming against the stone floor. The smaller beasts surged towards the cavern entrance, a black tide of hungry anticipation.

The massive creature watched them go, its own muscles twitching with a long-dormant yearning.

It stood straight in the cavern, the head reaching the ceiling. Its hands extended, and a low rumble erupted from its heart. Muscles spasmed when they tried to stretch, but after moving a little, it felt better than before.

A bit long and it was going to rule this part of the forest again and now, its rule would stretch to the human land.

The voice inside its head told him so.

***

In the dimly lit chamber atop the Archine Tower, a circle of robed figures huddled around a large pine table.

The only light emanated from a single orb suspended in the centre, painting shadows behind the wall.

An air of hushed tension permeated the room, punctuated only by the rhythmic tapping of a single long fingernail against the polished surface of the table.

"Are you certain of this, Eldren?" rasped a voice, the speaker obscured by a voluminous hood. "Dead? Mage Actra, dead?"

Eldren, a gaunt figure whose skeletal frame seemed barely contained by his robes, cleared his throat. "The report is clear, Magus Veridia. Actra perished in a skirmish with Arzan. Apparently, he… transformed and attacked the Baron."

A ripple of incredulous snorts echoed around the table. No one could believe the report that was given to them.

"Transformed?" scoffed another figure, tilting their head back to reveal a sliver of a sharp chin. "Into what, a particularly large toadstool? Don't insult our intelligence, Eldren."

“Into a monster.” Eldren’s voice came stern. “A winged one with claws. According to the report sent to us, the scent of dead mana was coming from him.”

Even though he couldn’t process what he had read, the fact that none of them believed it, made it rather frustrating.

A murmur of arguments rose. "These reports about Arzan," another voice chimed in, "speak of barely scraping the second circle. He’s a new mage. Actra, while far from brilliant, could at least manage a decent fireball. This tale is as absurd as it is insulting."

Eldren, unfazed by their derision, laid out the details gleaned from the report. Each mention of Arzan's supposed prowess elicited another round of scoffs and dismissive chuckles.

Moreover, none of them even gave heed to the fact that Actra had transformed into a monster.

"Second circle besting a veteran like Actra? I have heard better jokes from my grandson. It reeks of some elaborate fabrication," one mage declared, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Perhaps young Arzan has a talent for weaving fantastical stories."

“That could be a type of genius that Arzan could wield. Huh.”

The room dissolved into a cacophony of disbelieving pronouncements. When the report of Actra's death had come up, they had dug up every report on Arzan.

None of them had been particularly good as Actra considered him weak and foolish and after his awakening, things were simply more mysterious around him.

“All these reports from Actra… In a sense, the final report can be true. It makes sense if Arzan had been developing his circles— but the question is, how exactly did he do that?”

“I can’t think of a way. Actra’s mentions were mostly about his improvements, though the awakening is questionable as well,” another mage said while scratching his thin beard.

Eldren shook his head. “As questionable as it is, Actra’s reports are proof that he did. Our focus should be rather on the deceased mage, not on the awakened fresher,” he said in a whisper.

A sudden sharp crack echoed in the stillness, silencing the room. Magus Veridia slammed a bony fist onto the table, his black eyes looking

"Silence!" she commanded, her voice surprisingly powerful for such a frail figure.

“Things are strange. Still, a Mage of the Archine Tower had died. And one on its service to a noble house. We need to look into everything thoroughly. The part about Actra turning into a monster is blasphemy against our Tower and if they can't prove it, I'm going to personally demolish this young lord's territory, no matter what circle Mage he is.”

She leaned forward, her eyes glinting from beneath the shadows of her hood. “First of all, if we are all so curious about the truth of the report," she continued, her voice taking on a dangerous edge. "Why not summon this Arzan ourselves? Have him answer for himself. An interrogation at the Archine Tower seems fitting, wouldn't you agree?"

A tense silence followed.

The Mages exchanged uneasy glances. The death of a fellow Mage was a serious matter, even if they doubted the specifics of this report.

“That seems suitable, yes,” Eldren’s voice came true while he glanced at everyone, earning nods and hums.

Like this, it was decided to send a summon to Arzan.

57 - Francis Side chapter


A note from Extra26



This chapter comes after the Tradeheart arc.





A sigh escaped Francis’s lips as the only thing that filled the quiet room was the scratch of quill on parchment rhythmically.

He ran a hand through his thinning hair, a familiar ache settling in his lower back a constant reminder of long hours hunched over ledgers and decrees.

The cigar was placed between his index finger and middle finger as his tired eyes scanned the papers.

He was signing over a few documents, but his mind was on things that had taken place over a week back. Taking a break, he closed his eyes and thought back to things that would often flash in his mind.

His childhood.

He had started working at a young age.

From his early days as a lowly clerk, he was diligently copying figures under the watchful gaze of his predecessor, to the gradual ascent that saw him lauded for his keen organizational skills.

The memory of his initial ambition brought a bittersweet pang.

Back then, the mantle of administrator had felt like a beacon of hope.

He, Francis, a commoner born to constantly travelling merchant parents, had witnessed firsthand the toll of an inept lord on the lives of his people.

So many territories he visited had people suffering simply because the lord didn't care and when he had gotten a sense of what profession to move towards, Francis had come to Veralt.

It was a peaceful territory back then that could be improved even more. After taking an exam for the then-administrator, he became an apprentice.

He'd dreamed of wielding the authority to carve out a better life for the territory, a haven far removed from the hardships he had seen in his childhood.

For a while, it worked.

Fields yielded bountiful harvests, trade flourished, and a sense of tentative stability settled over the land. But then, the storm clouds arrived.

The Lord's son, his heir and confidant, was struck down by an arrow while chasing after a barbarian tribe in the army. The son died, leaving an empty shallow space in the estate itself.

Soon after that, the lord's wife passed away from an unknown illness. Having no other children, her son's death was too much to take for her.

The Lord himself, aged and grieving, retreated into a shell of his former self, his once-sharp mind clouded by sorrow.

Like dominoes toppling, the problems began stacking up.

A harsh winter decimated the crops, leaving the people with dwindling reserves. Bandit raids grew bolder, preying on weakened villages.

The Lord, lost in his grief, refused to acknowledge the escalating crisis, opting instead for a fatalistic wait for his demise.

Their pleas for assistance were met with a deafening silence. The ongoing Duke's succession had thrown the entire region into political turmoil.

Urgent messages dispatched to the Duke's house vanished, each unanswered letter a fresh wound upon their already beleaguered spirits.

The inevitable arrived finally.

The Lord succumbed to a heart attack, leaving a power vacuum in his wake. The territory, once a beacon of hope, now resembled a rudderless ship, tossed about in a sea of uncertainty.

Francis sighed again, recalling the time it all happened. He brought the cigar to his lips and let out a puff of smoke.

Then came the news.

Arzan, the Duke's son was appointed the new Baron. Relief, laced with a sliver of trepidation, bloomed in Francis' chest. Surely, a son of the Duke would possess the resources and resolve to pull them from the brink.

But six months had crawled by, each day a monotonous echo of the last.

Arzan, cloaked in an enigmatic aloofness, remained a distant figure. The problems, far from abating, seemed to fester. Disappointment, a bitter pill, lodged itself in Francis' throat. Was this all they could expect from a Duke's son?

Despair gnawed at him.

Six months under the new Baron Arzan, the territory's situation only worsened. The coffers bled dry, a consequence of Arzan's enigmatic spending sprees. Requests for clarification were met with a steely silence, the quite opposite of the openness Francis had craved.

As things kept moving towards destruction, Francis wondered if things were ever going to change.

And one day, it all changed.

The weaver’s incident still painted a shocking picture in his mind.

To be true to himself, he had given up on a lot of things. But that glimmer of hope— it ignited when Arzan took care of the weaver himself.

A new person— that’s what he would call Arzan after that day, at least in his mind.

Something about him changed and even if it was subtle, Francis instinctively knew he was different now. Someone reliable, someone competent and he proved it with each passing day.

Especially when the Tradeheart Merchant company threatened the farmlands.

In his old ways, Francis's only focus had been to find a way so that they could pay the debtors back, and hold them on for some more time. But then, Arzan— he brought up one matter Francis didn’t even think was possible.

The laws.

Francis still remembered how he almost slapped his forehead in guilt. Part of him despised him for being careless, but the other part understood the situation.

Soon after, Arzan took it upon himself to collect the money to pay back.

Francis knew Arzan’s plans to collect the debt would work meticulously, especially when he saw Heat stones— an invention of Arzan himself that was going to solve a lot of their problems.

After years, good things were happening in the territory, but it wasn’t enough. That one part that had started looking down on him craved something more.

He needed to prove that he was a good administrator— to a lord who suddenly had a spark to move forward without a glance back.

So, before Arzan left for the forest to deal with what he called mana fiends, Francis had one request, which was to let him handle the Tradeheart Merchant company.

Even if the debt was being handled, he had suspicions about the merchant organisation, but he had never been able to investigate, simply because their hands were tied with the debt.

Now, it was different.

Kai gave a brief nod that day, saying, “I trust you enough to handle it by yourself.” The words meant more when he started to get to work.

He focused on going through the kingdom’s law, to find any report that would prove Tradeheart’s wrongdoings. He remembered how his eyes stayed glued to the parchments, analysing every piece of information.

Fortunately, there were a lot.

The more he looked, the stranger things seemed

It had been over three years since Tradeheart had gotten a branch in Veralt and since then, the bandits' attacks increased. The thing that stood out was the fact that the attacks were mostly on merchants who were in direct competition with Tradeheart.

Especially, timber merchants who kept going out of business because of bandits targeting their carriages.

At the same time, Tradeheart grew its business, effectively gaining a monopoly.

For an entire month, Francis talked to merchants whose businesses had been flagged by bandits. Some cried, saying no matter how many guards and mercenaries they hired, the bandits would know their every move and steal their goods.

Others have already fled the city, wanting to not do any more business with Tradeheart having the bigger hand.

Unfortunately, he wasn't able to catch any bandits, but whatever he heard was enough for him to take his next move.

The door to his office creaked open as a short man walked in, looking fearful as Francis gestured for him to sit down. His shoulders slumped as the man looked at him.

“Hemlock,” Francis had called. “You have been working for Tradeheart for two years now, right?”

The man looked up, his eyes red-rimmed and weary. “Yes, sir. It's been a while. Can I know why you called me here? You even took my wife and mother with you. Is that necessary?”

“It is. And don’t worry, they are safe. I won't touch you until you answer my questions.”

Hemlock's eyes widened. Francis knew the man was smart and could get the undertone in his voice. By the way, he grabbed his knees, he was too nervous to not play along with the situation.

“What type of questions?”

“The one about the entity you work for,” Francis said, leaning forward. “You do know the lord particularly doesn't like Tradeheart right?”

“I-I do, but I thought it was just a debt…”

“It's more than that. Do you think I would call you here simply because of an insignificant debt?”

“Then?”

"We're conducting an investigation," Francis stated, his voice firm. "Discrepancies in your company's activities have been flagged. Moreover, there's a lot of evidence that your bosses had a hand in destroying a lot of businesses in the city for a monopoly. If you are not well versed in the laws, let me tell you. That's a serious crime."

Hemlock's face paled. "Discrepancies? I-I don't know what you mean," he stammered.

"Don't play coy," Francis leaned forward, his voice hardening. “You are a high-level employee who should have access to their documents. You very well know what's going on and there's enough merchants who would speak against Tradeheart if the lord is in their favour."

Hemlock swallowed hard, his gaze darting around the room. "I… I can't say anything. It's my job."

"Your job?" Francis scoffed. "Or your family's safety? Think about it. Are the Tradeheart scraps worth risking everything for? We can offer you protection, a chance to wipe the slate clean."

A flicker of desperation flickered in the man's eyes. He glanced at the door, then back at Francis. His lips trembled for a moment before forming a shaky whisper.

"What kind of protection?"

Francis smiled. "The kind that comes with the truth. Now, tell me everything and I will make sure you don't have to rot in a cell as your wife is sold to a brothel."

The deal was secured with Hemlock providing evidence along with many others. It seemed like a peek into Francis' ruthless side was enough for the meek man to help them out.

Weeks led into months.

The days were a relentless tide of paperwork, interviews, and late-night strategy sessions.

Along the way, Arzan’s expenditure to find the necromancer was brutal. They lost a few guards but managed to cease the threat. The next few weeks went by with Killian training what they called the Enforcers.

Although Francis had yet to see their prowess, he knew Killian seemed much stronger after turning into one.

According to Arzan, he would see their powers against Erasmus Thorne, the head of Tradeheart in Veralt.

The conversation a day before the raid on the Tradeheart office was still fresh in Francis' mind.

Arzan’s eyes scanned the pages of evidence Francis collected. Along with the parchments, there were written testimonies of merchants and Hemlock, alongside a few more people.

“I didn't get everything, my Lord," Francis concluded, "but it's enough to raise eyebrows. Enough to get Erasmus scrambling,” Francis said in a whisper with papers thrown on top of the table.

Arzan gave a genuine smile.

“This is more than what I could ask to bring those bastards down. Good job, Francis,” he said while his eyes went back to the papers.

A hint of pride beamed in his heart as he felt like he finally did something for the estate after so long.

The very next day, Erasmus was out of his high fort, beaten into a pulp by Arzan.

The attack was swift and decisive. City guards, bolstered by Arzan's newly acquired Enforcers, descended upon the Tradeheart Merchant company building.

Not one person in the Tradeheart office was able to stand against them and before they knew it, they were arresting Erasmus and all the employees who had been a part of his illegal activities.

News of the raid spread like wildfire in a couple of hours.

Francis felt a surge of vindication.

It hadn't been easy, but they did it. He had done it. With the debt finally disappearing from the looming state, he could finally focus on what he did best— rebuilding the territory, one sound decision at a time.

Opening his eyes away from the memories, he took a puff of cigar, smiling and finally felt like he had things to look forward to.

With renewed vigour, he got back to his work, the dull ache in his back disappearing.

Kai of the Sorcerer's Tower sat on the floor, his legs crossed in front of his bed. His eyes were closed as he focused on his circles.

All his senses were drawn away from the external environment due to how focused he got in his meditation every passing second. As he circled his mana around in his Mana Heart, he got closer to a particular feeling.

The feeling somehow— had become both familiar and frustrating. Mostly the latter because he had been trying for a long time now.

He sighed and inhaled, taking in a large amount of mana. He swirled them and with each complete circle, the speed increased.

A month. For a whole month, he'd been stuck at the cusp of the second circle, the bottleneck frustrating him more with each passing day.

Today, though, something felt different.

His Mana Heart felt unusual and he could feel the changes happening in it. The mana from the air felt chaotic, but as soon as he took hold of it, it responded to his will with coherence.

He pushed, channelling his focus, visualizing the swirling energy coalescing, solidifying.

Sweat beaded on his forehead and his face strained. The pressure kept building up as he circled more and more mana, trying to build up his third circle.

In the last month, he had tried several times and in a lot of them, he had managed to build his next circle, expanding his reserves, but as soon as he would let go, the circle would break, dissolving like it was never there.

He hoped it would be different this time.

He felt a sudden dissonance in his Mana Heart as his mana tried to build up his next circle, a force giving him a lot of mental pressure, but he kept at it.

Minutes turned into hours, but he didn't give up. His Mana took on the form of his next circle, in the middle of the two he had made before.

Then, a click resounded. Not an audible click, but a feeling, a shift in the very core of his being. The Mana Heart, once a churning vortex, settled, a vibrant sphere pulsing with controlled power.

Slowly, he let go, but the third circle didn't disperse. It settled there, pulsing with mana and giving him far more energy than he had expected.

A wide grin split Kai's face.

The third circle, breached!

The rush he felt was something he hadn’t sensed in quite a long time. It was like his whole being steamed with newfound power and every breath he took filled him with a refreshing feeling.

He flickered his wrist with ease, a flame appearing on his fingertip. It seemed to be much stronger than before, giving a bright glow.

He killed the flame down after a few seconds and did a refreshing spell to get rid of the exhaustion. He pushed himself up, feeling the energy bursting in his muscles.

Stretching his body, he glanced out the window.

Morning light bathed the view in a golden glow and as he breathed in the mana-rich environment, flashbacks came to his mind.

It felt like only a moment ago he'd been battling with the mana fiend, then the next second, being awakened in a different body with an inability to feel the rush of mana — it was horrifying, to say the least.

After having spent all his life battling mana fiends, he had never expected to regress in time and awaken in the body of a young lord. It had all been strange, but in the last few months, he had gotten used to it.

The season of Frosania had passed and the first month of Florana was here. The snow was melting and people were finally feeling more energetic.

When he had first become Arzan, he had been powerless, riddled with debt and other responsibilities, but now, his territory was on the path of recovery.

Moreover, in just a few months, he had become a third circle mage from a mortal.

His stomach grumbled suddenly, pulling him back from his memories. He had been trying to reach the third circle since waking up and he had missed the morning training.

Breakfast was already long gone, but it didn't matter now.

He withdrew himself from the window and walked across the room, reaching the door and opening it with a creak.

He paused as he saw a familiar face.

There, by the doorway, stood Claire, wearing her usual maid uniform, her brow creased with concern.

"Good morning, Lord Arzan," she said, her voice a gentle murmur.

Kai forced a smile. "Good morning, Claire.”

Her lips pursed slightly. "Didn’t want to disturb you since I saw you were meditating," she said, searching his face for something. “Breakfast has gone cold, but I could heat it again.”

While saying that, she gave him a particular look which he knew by now. It was the one she reserved for him whenever he pushed himself too hard, a silent plea for him to prioritise his well-being.

In the past month, he had been trying to break the barrier to the third circle and due to it, he had been skipping his meals often. It had worried everyone who knew him closely, particularly Francis, Killian and Claire.

Even Amyra had asked about it, but he shrugged off the conversation every time.

“Thanks,” he said. “Since it’s past breakfast time, I’d skip it for the day. I'm feeling good after a long time and I believe I won't be skipping meals from now on,” he said with a smile.

His intestines yearned for food, but the surge of mana he felt was enough for him to not care about it.

Claire's lips pressed into a firm line, but as she heard the last line, she smiled.

“That's good news. I would let the chef know. He had been worried that his food hadn't been up to your tastes these days,” she said. “Are you going to head to the library then?”

“Yes, I believe Amyra will be waiting for me. It's already late.”

The path to the library was mostly silent. A few whispers among the maids, and passing guards who gave curt nods at Kai— he had gotten used to this treatment and didn't flinch at it like before.

Reaching the library, Claire opened the door and they saw Amyra standing at her usual position.

Seeing Kai, her arms folded and a scowl etched on her face. It turned to a pout as she stared at him.

It had become a part of their routine to build golems together early in the library. It was training for him since he had been progressing into Golemancy, but for Amyra, it had turned into a fun hobby.

He approached the table and suddenly, her expression shifted. Her golden eyes widened comically, her pout dissolving into surprise.

It seems like she's able to feel the increase in my mana. Though, she doesn't seem to have much idea of my exact strength.

Kai smiled as he stood beside her.

Looking at her brought back memories of the battle against the necromancer. Amyra had been one of his captives and after he saved her, she had been living in the estate as a guest.

By building golems together, he had been trying to get close to her, being curious about her origins and although progress was slow, she had grown comfortable with him.

“Sorry for keeping you waiting. I got busy,” he said, his eyes going over to the table that was filled with lumps of clay. On one side, sculptures they have made over the last month were displayed.

“It's okay. We can start now that you are here.”

Amyra didn't ask anything more about the surge of mana around him and although it disappointed him, he focused on the clay.

As he got on with their practice, Claire mixed in the background without making any noise.

The damp clay felt cool and flexible beneath Kai's fingers.

Months of practice had transformed his initial clumsiness into a practised ease. Soon, he would be able to start building a real golem, one that could move and act as commanded.

He had read up on the process and tried to find more books about it. However, he had no success with it, so he was on his own with the necromancer's journal being his only guide.

Even with that, he had gotten a good understanding of building up a clay golem, creating channels inside of it and connecting it to the golem core which was the main part of any golem.

It was a hard process, but he would be able to start on it within a month.

Narrowing his eyes, Kai focused more on the figure at hand, forgetting about all his future goals, and instead putting the work to his present.

He moulded the head, smoothing the contours with practised movements. A side glance revealed Amyra across from him, her own golem taking shape with impressive speed. Hers was a humanoid form, sleek and agile-looking, quite different to Kai's hulking brute of a creation.

“Have you completed the book I gave you?” He asked, trying to strike up a conversation as they worked.

She took a moment to respond, her eyes not leaving the clay. “Yes, it was interesting. There were a lot of descriptions about golems and how they worked. Though, the sketches were rough.”

“I drew them,” he muttered as a matter of fact. Amyra looked up in horror, but he chuckled. “Well, they were indeed rough. I never got time to make them better. Glad you liked it.”

His words seemed to ease her up as she nodded her head slowly.

“T-thank you for making it for me,” she muttered, her soft voice barely audible, but he heard her clearly and smiled.

Two weeks back, she had asked him for a book on golemancy since she had gotten interested in it, building up the clay figures with him.

Since he couldn't give her the book written by the necromancer in case bad memories resurfaced, he wrote one down himself.

They lapsed back into silence, the rhythmic scrape of clay the only sound in their corner.

Across the room, Claire sat at her usual table, hunched on a book. A stolen glance revealed her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to decipher a passage.

Kai noticed the book cover as she took it to her hand and knew he had read it months prior. It was a storybook about a young king and his fight to protect his kingdom from a demon king. It was mostly a children's book with lots of pictures to go with the text, perfect for Claire who could follow it without any difficulty.

His focus came back to the clay in his hand and stayed there for the next hour.

It only broke when with a satisfied grunt, Amrya stepped back from her creation.

Her golem stood tall and proud, the clay smoothed to a flawless finish.

Kai nodded appreciatively. “It seems like it could take down a troll and ask for seconds. You are improving at a rapid pace.”

Amrya gave a shy smile. "Yours isn't bad either.”

Kai looked down at his own creation, a pang of disappointment pricking him. Compared to Amrya's elegant design, his golem looked like a pile of misshapen clay. But when taken individually, his wasn’t bad.

Or maybe on a second note, he was being too critical about his handiwork.

Mine is good, hers is just better.

It couldn't be helped since unlike Amyra, he couldn't give his entire day to practising with clay. When they had first started, he was clearly better, but with time, Amyra had taken a good lead.

It was to the point where he felt like she would do a better job building up an actual golem than him.

"Actually," he mumbled, "I was thinking…"

Amrya raised an eyebrow, a flicker of curiosity sparking in her eyes as she waited for him to finish his words.

“Do you want to help me build an actual golem, like the one in the book I gave you?” he asked.

Amrya stared at him for a long moment, then a slow grin spread across her face. “Yes! I would love to!"

***

Kai leaned across the worn table, his finger tracing a winding path across the faded map of Veralt city.

Francis sat opposite him, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Since he had taken charge of things, Kai had ended a few problems the city faced. The bandit situation was a thing of the past, people weren't dying of hunger anymore and the reopening of the mines had breathed new life into the territory's economy.

But for Kai, the victory felt hollow.

His trips through the city painted a sad picture— crumbling infrastructure, pockets of desperate poverty, and a palpable sense of despair clinging to the air like a shroud.

His community kitchen, while helpful, was a mere band-aid on a gaping wound.

So, to deal with other issues, Francis wanted to consult Kai.

They divided the whole city into different parts, areas which needed more mending and areas that were doing comparatively better. It seemed like the whole city was planned better than he had expected.

There were clear lines, separating streets with farmers living on the western side and miners on the east. Merchants and other shop owners lived more in the middle and the noble estate was across the river with the guards' quarters evenly spread out.

Since the city was large enough to accommodate a lot of people, Kai had several plans running in his mind.

"We can't just rely on the mines, Francis," Kai said, "It'll help, sure, but it's not enough. We need a long-term plan, something sustainable."

Francis nodded, his gaze flicking around the map. "Indeed, my Lord. The living conditions in the miners' area are appalling, to say the least. Almost a slum. Most of our people depend upon farming and mining, so creating more industries would certainly help. For now, I believe we need to mend their living conditions."

"Exactly," Kai said, jabbing a finger at a specific area. "That's our priority. We need to improve their housing, and sanitation, and invest in proper equipment. From what I saw when I was in the mines, there was barely any protective equipment." His gaze swept across the rest of the map. "The rest of the city isn't much better. We need repairs, clean-up crews, cobblers to mend the roads…”

The sheer scale of the task was daunting, but it was long due. Kai still recalled his first trip to the city and how everything looked like a ghost town.

If he was going to correct things, he couldn't be satisfied with the bare minimum.

"Roads themselves are a mess. Potholes everywhere, some streets are barely passable. We'll have to prioritise based on what's in a more critical condition."

Francis scribbled notes furiously, taking keen details into attention.

"And," Kai continued, a thoughtful expression replacing his earlier frustration, “I've been thinking about setting up a school in the city. We don't even have one and most people can't even read and write. If we let it be, most of them would never develop their talents.”

“Isn't the church school enough?” Francis asked. There was a Church of Luminous in the city that provided basic history lessons and maths to kids.

Kai had heard about them and from what he knew, the things they taught were aimed more at the indoctrination of kids to their church rather than giving them a basic education.

He wanted to change that.

“No, it's not. Kids don't learn anything other than how great the gods are there. We need to take a more practical approach,” he explained, receiving a frown from Francis who seemed to have concerns.

“Lord Arzan, although your idea is—”

A sharp rap on the door startled them both. A guard, his face serious, poked his head into the room. "Lord Arzan," he announced, his voice tight. "There's someone from the capital here. They are requesting your presence."

Kai looked at Francis and exchanged a surprised look.

Who is it now?

They said they are from Archine Tower.

The words of the guard hung in his mind as Kai walked, ending his meeting with Francis abruptly.

He had already expected this when Francis requested to send the report, though he couldn’t help the curiosity that built in his mind as he strode into the meeting room where the said people waited for him.

With Francis by his side, their steps quickened as they opened the oak door with a creak.

He sensed the heightened mana as soon as he entered the room. Although he had expected them to send someone, it was still a bit of surprise that the ones they sent were Mages.

A part of him was excited about the prospect since he was curious about the level of Mages in Archine Tower. He had seen the prowess of Actra, but he was clearly not a Battlemage.

He also didn't know what his standing was in the tower. Was he a middle ranked member or a lower ranked one?

Having these questions bubbling inside of him, he gave a curt nod at Killian, who stood by the door, his hand resting casually on the pommel of his sheathed sword. His gaze flicked between Kai and the emissaries, a silent question hanging in the air.

Then, Kai looked up at the two Mages from the capital.

They stood stiffly by the large wooden table, their robes a deep crimson that seemed to absorb the light itself. Kai took one full glance at how fearless they stood.

One of them had light crimson hair and was rather short while the other one was a bit taller with dirty blonde hair. Both of their faces were basic a bit pudgy, clearly hinting at the fact that they weren't used to moving their bodies.

His eyes wandered and took in the more intricate details.

A golden insignia, a stylised gryphon with outstretched wings, gleamed on their chests. A flicker of recognition sparked in Kai's mind.

It was the same symbol he'd seen engraved into a dusty amulet he'd found in Actra's room.

The taller of the two robed figures turned towards Kai. A hint of smugness, subtle but unmistakable, tinged his neutral expression. He didn't bow, nor did he offer any form of greeting.

"Are you Baron Arzan?" the Mage rasped, his voice cold and devoid of warmth.

Kai straightened, not appreciating his tone or the way he looked at him. "I am," he replied, his voice firm. "What brings you to my territory?"

The man slammed a document onto the table. It was a bunch of parchment, neatly tied by a seal. "Well, then," he intoned, voice dripping with false gravitas. "You are hereby under arrest for the murder of Actra Dhuran by decree of the Archine Tower."

Kai’s eyes narrowed.

“Murder?” he drawled. “That’s a pretty hefty accusation to throw around in someone else’s house, especially without any proof.”

The calmness that reeked out of his body made the two Mages glance at each other. He wasn't bothered by them at all, already sensed their strengths by the subtle mana flowing out of them.

The shorter Mage, previously silent, scoffed. “Proof? The Archine Tower commands it. What more proof do you want?”

Kai snorted back, mimicking his attitude. "That 'command' wouldn't hold water in a leaky bucket. I thought Mages are known for being knowledgeable, but it seems like you didn't even bother reading the report I sent to the Archine Tower."

The Mages bristled, their faces scrunching at the insult.

“That's an insult towards the Archine Tower and at me,” the taller one hissed, his voice tight with poorly concealed frustration. "You will come with us to participate in the investigation!"

The shorter Mage, his face flushed with anger, reached into a pouch at his belt and produced a pair of gleaming handcuffs. Embedded within the metal were faint pulsations— syphon stones, meant to drain a Mage's mana.

Kai watched the display with cool amusement. "Handcuffs in my own home? Now that's just disrespectful. Especially since you two don't seem to have the power to back it up."

The taller one’s face turned to a scowl. Not the adorable kind, but the kind that could scare a child with only one blink. "What do you mean we don't have the power?" His voice raised by the end, demanding a challenge.

Kai raised an eyebrow. "I mean you're weak," he stated bluntly. "Just a couple of puffed-up pigeons with fancy robes."

Hearing that, the shorter Mage grunted in rage. With a snarl, he unleashed a gust of wind aimed directly at Kai's chest.

Kai, however, barely flinched. He sidestepped the spell with a casual grace. The wind howled past, sending shivers down Killian's spine but missing Kai by a hair's breadth.

The taller Mage, fueled by his partner's failure, launched a [Fireball] at Kai. The projectile hurtled towards him, a sphere of pure destructive energy.

But before it could connect, Killian materialized between Kai and the fireball. With a swift movement, he unsheathed his sword and met the it head-on.

A searing hiss filled the room as Killian's blade clashed with the spell and it exploded. The force of the impact sent the Mage staggering backwards, his face contorted in surprise. The fireball sputtered and died, leaving behind a faint wisp of smoke.

The shorter Mage, still fuming from his failed wind spell, gritted his teeth and formed another spell structure on his palm. Kai recognised it as a second circle spell called [Wind Blade].

A crescent of raw wind energy materialized in his hand, crackling with ominous power.

Kai didn’t need time to process. A counter-spell, a mirror image of the wind blade, met the Mage's attack head-on.

The two forces collided in a miniature explosion that sent a gust of wind swirling around the room. Books tumbled from shelves, and papers fluttered to the floor.

The Mage stared, his eyes shaking with with disbelief. He clearly hadn't expected Kai to be strong enough to counter a second circle spell with such ease.

“Since you attacked first, don't expect me to be cordial,” he said, seizing the initiative and channelling his mana.

Crimson flames erupted from his fingertips, twisting and coiling into a fiery whip. With a flick of his wrist, he lashed out, the whip wrapping around both the Mages and binding them tightly. Their crimson robes smouldered slightly, but the flames weren't hot enough to cause serious injury.

It was [Infernal Whip], a third circle spell with tons of applications and one perfect for scenarios like these.

He gave a gentle unbothered smile and cast another spell.

A spell structure formed and out of thin air, a flaming arrow popped up. It cut through the air and aimed right in between the tall one’s face as he closed his eyes. Before it could hit him, Kai stopped it just in time.

"See? Attacking a guest in their own home isn't exactly proper etiquette. Seems the Archine Tower Mages haven't been keeping up with their training courtesy courses."

The shorter Mage, despite being bound, glared at Kai. "We were under orders to apprehend you. Get us off these whips or you would be—" he tried to spat, but Kai simply turned the arrow towards him, making him wince.

"Let's first try introductions, shall we?" Kai's voice was a low growl. “You already know my name. So, it's only proper you give your names and titles.”

“I'm Jacks Krahlet, second circle Apprentice Mage,” the taller one said, his eyes stuck on the arrow as he gritted his teeth.

“Klan Markson, second circle Apprentice Mage,” The shorter one muttered, frowning.

“Good.” Kai smiled. “Now, answer every one of my questions without fail or I won't hesitate to burn you to ashes.”

“Y-you can't do that,” Jacks said. “Harming Archine Tower Mages is a crime and a punishable offence. You won't be able to get away with it. The king itself would strip you away of everything and—”

“You did the same to me, so whatever I am doing here is self-defence. You two really take me for a weakling. You are accusing me of killing a third circle Mage and if I actually could kill him, why do you think I would spare your lives?”

His words made them cower as they seemed to realise what a massive mistake they had made. Kai assumed that they believed that Actra had actually been killed by deceit. Or at least the report he had sent was false.

As he saw them nodding in fear, he began asking his questions. “Why am I under arrest?"

Klan, his bravado dampened by the fiery arrow in front of his face, squirmed under Kai's gaze. "Look," he finally muttered, "it's a… a summons, alright? An official request from the Archine Tower for your cooperation in their investigation."

Kai raised an eyebrow, skepticism etched on his face.

He snatched the document from the table, his eyes scanning the text. It was indeed a summons, a formal request for his presence at the Archine Tower. But anger still simmered in him.

"Then why the arrest?" he demanded. "If it's a summons, why the theatrics?"

The two Mages remained silent, their faces flushed with a mixture of shame and fear. The flaming arrow flared brighter, casting an ominous glow on the room.

Finally, Jacks mumbled a sheepish quality to his voice, "We… we were under the impression you wouldn't follow a simple summons. Thought we'd… encourage your cooperation."

The corner of Kai's mouth twitched. "Encourage? Or were you simply trying to exert your authority, and enjoy a few days at my expense under the guise of an arrest? Did you hear that I’m a Mage before?"

Both of them flinched, their charade crumbling under his scrutiny. "We…" Klan stammered. "We received word you were a Mage, but…"

"But we never expected me to be this powerful. We were told you were never trained by the tower or by another Mage.” Jacks finished, lowering his head and sighing.

Kai frowned, tossing the document onto the table. He gestured to Francis, who had remained silent but observant throughout the ordeal. "Francis," he said, his voice calm but firm. "Get these gentlemen some rooms. I'll think about accompanying them to the Archine Tower… at my own pace."

He shook his head and the arrows vanished from the air, making the two Mages take a sigh of relief.

Klan, emboldened by the removal of the flaming arrows, puffed up his chest. "If you don't comply with the summons, the Archine Tower—"

Kai cut him off with a sharp glare. "I never said I wouldn't comply. I said I'd go when I want to. For now, you'll stay here and behave yourselves. Next time, the flames won't be so forgiving. Also, I would talk to you again soon about the Tower and the summons. For now, go with Francis and don't dare to do anything that you won't be able to handle the consequences of."

The two Mages nodded at the same time, their eyes filled with horror.

***

The rhythmic rumble of the carriage wheels lulled Kai into a contemplative silence.

Killian sat opposite him, his sharp eyes scanning the passing scenery. From time to time, his mouth would twitch, but he would stop himself from speaking up.

Finally, seeming unable to contain his curiosity any longer, he spoke.

"Those Mages from Archine Tower," Killian said. "What are you going to do about them?"

Kai sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. "Honestly? I knew the Archine Tower would come knocking, but I didn't expect it to be this fast." He tapped the document resting on his lap— the official summons, a thin sheet of parchment that called him to the Tower to be questioned.

It had an official tone and it was written that it was a simple investigation. Though, Kai didn't believe it.

"Going by the tone of the summon," Kai continued, “It seems they haven't bought Actra's transformation story. Can't blame them, really. Until someone else sees a man transforming into a monstrous creature, it's hard to swallow."

Killian nodded in agreement. "Indeed. Your word, even as a Baron, won't be enough against the Archine Tower. They are an entity that even rivals the authority of the royal family.”

"Exactly," Kai said. "I have to go, answer their questions. But I won't go unprepared."

He leaned back in his seat, his gaze flickering out the window. Curiosity lingered in his eyes about the tower.

"Honestly, Killian, I'm curious about this Archine Tower. They're the pinnacle of magical authority in the entire kingdom. Powerful Mages, rumoured to possess libraries worth of magical knowledge and countless other things…" His voice trailed off, lost in contemplation.

The carriage lurched to a halt before he could speak more, jolting them both back to reality. The coachman, a gruff man named Bart, stuck his head through the window. "We're here, Lord Arzan," he announced.

“Let's talk about it later,” Kai said, looking at Killian who nodded.

Both of them got off the carriage, stepping out into a sea of wheat swaying gently in the breeze.

His mind shifted back from the topic of the Mages as he felt the wind on his face. Today he was out to inspect the farmlands.

60. Farmlands


A note from Extra26





From Londoner

To Lord





This is a slow progression kingdom-builder story, with a lot of focus on world-building and eventually, industrialization and tech-uplifting. The story is going to be very, very long. Settle in for a slow burn, where the journey is just as important as the destination. Welcome aboard!



* * *



Steven awakens to a nightmare. Transported to a brutal medieval kingdom on a faraway planet, he finds himself in the body of Kivamus, the exiled third son of a Duke. Banished to a crumbling frontier village called Tiranat, a bandit-ridden backwater located within untamed forests, Kivamus faces a harsh awakening as its newly made Baron.

Tiranat is a far cry from Steven's comfortable London life. Here, survival is a daily battle, resources are scarce, and technology is a distant dream. Yet, a flicker of hope remains for Kivamus - memories of a technologically advanced world.

Armed only with the ingenuity of a modern mind, Kivamus defies despair. He sees potential where the villagers only see struggle. He dreams of using his knowledge to forge a new future for Tiranat, a future fueled by industry, a concept alien to this medieval society.

But the path to progress is full of challenges. Navigating the cut-throat world of medieval politics, earning the wary trust of the villagers, and overcoming the limitations of a resource-scarce world are just the beginning.

This is the story of Kivamus, a man reborn, forced to carve a new destiny in a world both harsh and exhilarating.

But before anything else, he will recreate indoor plumbing, dammit!





The farmland was a practical sprawl, divided into neat, rectangular plots, it stretched as far as the eye could see. Kai let his eyes roam around the field for a few seconds and noticed it was filled with wheat crops mainly with other minor crops laid out in a few patches.

He could see serfs and other workers by the field, eyeing him with curiosity, but not daring to walk towards him. Instead, they choose to bow their heads and keep working, glancing at him in between.

Trees covered the furthest boundaries he could see, but the yield attracted his attention. He stepped forward, feeling the gentle warm breeze that had hints of coldness to it.

The outskirts of his territory were divided into smaller plots. These plots were loaned to serfs, offering them a chance to farm their own land and keep a significant portion of the harvest.

On the other side of the manor, closer to the heart of his domain, there were plots with different ownership structures— deeds of property granted to families for their achievements, allowing them to build a more permanent stake in the land. Though, it was far less common.

It had been a few months since he had become Arzan and hadn't bothered to check up on the farmlands more than once. Even then, it was mostly to get them to grow particular herbs that they could use to make soup.

Now, he wanted a far more permanent solution to their worries of food shortage and the first step was to inspect why the farmlands haven't been yielding good crops, despite the soil being good for farming.

As Kai and Killian surveyed the fields, a sense of unease settled upon them. He felt himself shifting his feet, trying to mask the frown that made its way to his face.

The wheat, while tall and golden, lacked the vibrancy of a healthy crop.

The stalks seemed thinner, the heads less full, a hollowness that was clear to anyone who looked at it.

In between the wheat, other crops fared no better— wilting vegetables, and stunted legumes, all painted in a palette of sickly yellow and brown.

A sinewy man, his forehead drawn with worry lines deeper than any plough could carve, followed them. He bowed low, his wrinkly yet firm hand gripping a worn straw hat. "Lord Arzan," he said."I am Ubert, steward of the fields and the one who handles most things here. I'm honoured you have come to check up on the fields."

"Ubert," Kai acknowledged, his voice mirroring the man's seriousness. "Thank you for meeting us. Things look a bit hectic from afar,” he said, trying to understand the situation better.

Ubert’s eyes flickered towards the farmland. Something beneath the mask he put up almost showed itself, but he soon gave a broad smile.

“Things have been, so-so, Lord Arzan. But we’ve hope in Goddess Thalassa. Will your lordship take a tour? See the crops closer?”

Kai nodded. “We'd appreciate a tour of the farm."

Ubert smiled, his gaze lingering on the troubled fields. "Of course, my Lord."

As they walked, Kai peppered Ubert with questions. The harvest last year, Ubert explained, had been dismal. Crops had withered and died, their potential choked out. The farmers, despite their best efforts, had little to show for their labour.

As the crops weren't of quality, they weren't able to sell them to merchants. Tons of them had to be disposed of too, giving them one problem after another.

"We've prayed to Goddess Thalassa," Ubert said, referring to the deity associated with water and fertility, "but the rains haven't come. The land itself seems… tired."

“Had the problems only started popping up last year?” Kai asked, looking at Ubert who shook his head.

“No, it's been going downhill for a few years now. We used to have one of the biggest harvests in the whole Dukedom before, but it's a thing of the past now. The previous lord, may his soul rest in peace, gave up on finding solutions to our problems in the last phases of his life,” Ubert said, looking at the sky before lowering his head towards the fields. “We tried getting fertilisers and other solutions from merchants that might help us, but it was all in vain.”

Kai could only nod to his words. He knew everything was true since Francis had said similar things and he could see the crops for himself. Just the view made him wince internally.

What exactly is the problem here? Is it the soil or something else?

He knelt beside a sickly stalk of wheat, his brow furrowed in concern.

He ran his fingers through the dry soil, his senses tingling with the faint hum of life beneath the surface. But something was odd.

As he pushed his mana into the soil to inspect it, he only felt faint traces of mana in the soil. Normally, it could be explained as normal crops also tend to use miniscule amounts of mana in their growth, but the wheat didn't seem to be absorbing the mana.

It hardly looked good and if they would have taken so much mana, they would have shown signs of corrosion on them.

He inspected more stalks and moved forward, trying to find what was draining all the mana. Then, he paused.

A pungent odour tickled his nose. He spotted a small, spindly plant with purple flowers nestled amongst the wheat roots.

He plucked it out, his eyes widening in realization. "Ubert," he said sharply, holding up the plant. "What is this doing here?"

Ubert squinted at the weed. "Oh, that's Stinkweed. We plant them around the crops, my Lord. They keep the pests away with their strong smell. They're quite effective and easy to maintain."

Kai shook his head, a frustrated sigh escaping his lips. "Effective, yes," he said, "but for what? They're also leeching nutrients and mana from the soil, choking the wheat. That's why the crops are withering!"

He looked at Ubert and noticed the confused look on the man’s face. He clearly had no idea what the weed actually functioned like.

On another note, Kai couldn’t believe they let Stinkweed into the farm and held them there for this long. No wonder the field was about to die.

It wasn't like the weed wasn't used for pests, but the logical way of using them was to plant and remove them after two weeks before they could grow their roots to start absorbing mana and nutrients.

He inhaled deeply and shook his head.

“I- I didn't know about it,” Ubert said, a hint of guilt in his voice.

"Well, Stinkweed is indeed effective at keeping pests away, Ubert. They're used in smelling bombs for a reason— that pungent odour is quite repulsive to insects. But here's the problem." Kai crushed the Stinkweed between his fingers, releasing a stronger burst of the foul smell. "While they deter pests, they also have a nasty habit of absorbing nutrients and even mana from nearby plants. They're essentially stealing the life force the wheat needs to grow."

Ubert's face contorted in disbelief. "But… how? We've been using Stinkweed for years! There was a terrible locust problem two seasons back, and these were the only things that saved the crops."

Kai nodded in understanding. "I see. But a temporary solution shouldn't become a permanent problem, Ubert. The Stinkweed might have saved you from the locusts, but they've been slowly weakening the soil ever since. Get them out of here, all of them. We'll find other ways to deal with the pests. If you actually want to use them, remove them before they can grow their roots."

His gaze swept across the vast expanse of the fields, a plan forming in his mind.

The golden wheat, while not quite a sickly yellow, lacked the vibrant green of a healthy crop. They needed water, and relying solely on Goddess Thalassa's whims wasn't going to cut it.

"We need a more reliable irrigation system, Ubert," Kai declared. "We can't keep depending on the rain for our harvest. I'm pretty sure you make use of the river, but we need to utilise it better,” he said, looking at Ubert who was listening intently. "We can divert some of that water, channel it through the fields… imagine, a network of irrigation canals, bringing life-giving water directly to the crops."

Killian who was silent the entire time spoke. "Building irrigation channels would take time, my Lord. We'd need to gather materials, hire labour."

"We have time, Killian," Kai countered. After seeing the plants suffer and knowing the troll it took on the economy, he didn’t want to ignore the problems that he could solve. "And with the Stinkweed gone, the next season's harvest will already see a significant improvement. But in the meantime, Ubert.” He turned to the farm steward. "I have a proposition for you. Are you open to trying something a little unusual?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Ubert's face at the last part of his sentence.

"Unusual plants, my Lord?" he echoed, scratching his head with a calloused hand.

"Indeed," Kai said, a hint of a smile playing on his lips. "There are a few plants I know of, with shorter harvest times, perfect for the next season planting. They won't yield massive quantities, but they'll provide a safety net, ensuring we don't face food shortages."

Ubert, while sceptical, nodded in agreement. He seemed like he wasn't familiar with these "unusual" plants, but the Lord's word held weight. Besides, anything was better than another year of meagre harvests.

Kai nodded back and got back onto his inspection, his mind buzzing with possibilities.

The nutrients and mana from the soil had been sucked away by the Stinkweed and it would take a while for them to replenish on its own, so he probably would have to push his own mana into the soil, making sure to make it unexpected, so the soil could absorb it well.

It wasn't a hard job and he guessed he would be able to finish it in a week.

He glanced at Killian, then back at the vast expanse of the field. An idea began to take root as he looked at a few areas that weren't being used yet.

"Killian," he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper. “What do you think about using a section of the land for alchemical herbs and magical plants?"

Killian raised an eyebrow. "Alchemical herbs, my Lord? Here? Wouldn't that be a bit unconventional? I doubt the serfs know how to grow them."

Kai grinned. "Unconventional, perhaps, but with the right planning, it could be incredibly beneficial. Imagine a steady supply of rare ingredients for potions and enchantments, readily available right here on our doorstep. It would not only bolster our own resources, but could potentially become a source of trade with other regions."

Killian stroked his chin thoughtfully. "An interesting proposition, my Lord. Certainly worth considering. But wouldn't it require significant investment in terms of magical wards and security? We would also have to get seeds and look into how to acquire plants such as those."

Kai’s mind was already running a mile at the thought. He was about to reply when their conversation was cut short.

A strange sensation prickled at Kai's skin, a ripple in the very air itself, a surge of raw mana. Before he could even react, Killian looked at him.

"My Lord?" Killian's voice was sharp with urgency. "What is it?"

Kai didn't answer.

His gaze snapped upwards, a plume of smoke rising into the otherwise clear sky. And then came a sound that sent a jolt of lightning down his spine— a loud, screeching roar that echoed through the fields.

Without a word, Kai launched himself forward, a powerful wind spell propelling him with unnatural speed.

What the hell is that?!

He sprinted through the fields, rounding a bend and bursting onto the streets where onlookers were also staring at the spot the smoke was coming from.

Just by looking at it, he knew where it was.

He took a few more turns as the wind around his legs propelled him forward, his body barely keeping up with the speed as he nearly fell on a turn. Still, he kept running and soon, the view of the main gate came in front of his eyes.

His heart plummeted into his stomach as he gazed upon the structure that now lay in ruins, a gaping hole torn through its centre.

Smoke and dust billowed into the sky, obscuring the view of what lay beyond.

And amidst the chaos, a monstrous figure emerged from the wreckage, its silhouette casting a grotesque shadow across the land.
