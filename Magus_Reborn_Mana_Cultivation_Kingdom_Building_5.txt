Immortality is more fun when it isn't the source of your misfortune.

Finding himself thrust into a world of magic, mystery, and monsters, Eric wants nothing more than to explore, adventure, and discover Vanir and its infinite secrets.

But it's hard to enjoy your new life and magical powers when you get branded as a demon and hunted to the ends of the world.

Fire tempers steel, scars toughen the skin, and hardship condenses resolve. Armed with a system and an endless parade of foes, Eric will rise to the challenges ahead to survive.

But when legends fall and gods tremble, it's hard for Eric to care. If Vanir and its inhabitants didn't want an enemy, they shouldn't have made him one.

The main character will have a self-healing ability and another strong ability but it won't be revealed until halfway through book 1.

A lot of Characters had unique abilities that would slowly be developed. (From simple to overpowered)

Slow start but the story will quickly pick up the pace.

This is a very long series.





Kai was at the forefront of the guards.

The Tradeheart Merchant Company's heavy oak doors opened with a groan. Kai stepped forward, his eyes fixed on the interior of the building.

A gaggle of guards, wearing their uniform and armed with short swords came forward from behind a nearby pillar. Their faces showed fear and defiance.

The guards were composed of Bord and Feroy since the rest of the Enforcers were taking a rest due to the awakening. The four others were back in the castle recovering from fainting— but Killian made sure to tag along with the duo who were awake and still processing what their body underwent.

Well… Isn’t this a sight?

Kai looked at the muscular man with a thick beard who stepped forward, brandishing his sword.

"Halt!" he yelled, his voice cracking slightly. "This is private property. State your business or leave!"

Kai stopped, a sardonic smile playing on his lips. He scanned the guards, their ill-fitting uniforms and mismatched weaponry, a stark contrast to his well-trained guards.

He knew most of them were just hired low-level mercenaries since the Tradeheart merchant company branch in Veralt City wasn't big enough for proper guards.

But if there were a way they could walk inside without creating a scene, that would make things much easier for him.

"Tell your men to stand down," Kai said, his voice calm but firm. "This is an official visit. We're here to see Erasmus Thorne."

The bearded guard puffed out his chest, trying to appear intimidating. "Orders are orders. You can't just waltz in here with an army."

Kai's smile evaporated. His gaze turned cold. "These are city guards, keeping the citizens safe. If you persist in obstructing us, I will consider it a threat and be forced to act accordingly. Don't you know me? I'm the Lord of the city. Put your voice down or you will be taken into custody."

A ripple of unease passed through the Tradeheart guards. They looked at each other in confusion and nervousness and a few of them whispered among themselves.

If they were in the city for long, they knew who Kai was. Sadly, they didn't seem to budge.

“No, we still can’t allow you to head inside. Until we’re given a different order, we won’t allow you to go inside,” the security guard that was to the front said.

Kai exchanged glances with Killian. It was time to put all their training into practice.

Kai nodded. “Make space for us.”

“Guards,” Killian yelled and lunged forward.

The security guard pushed Killian back— or at least he tried to. Killian grabbed both of his wrists and twisted it around, making the sword slip out of his grasp.

It happened in a brief moment, the rest of the security guards threw themselves forward— swords hanging in the air.

Kai stayed back with Francis and another guard who held a chest in his hands. All of them took in the sight of the rough fight.

Bran had his arm around a security guard's neck, while the latter tried his best to break free. With Bran’s free hand, he grabbed the sword that was hanging from the security’s hand and wrapped his hand around it.

With a swift move, he twisted his body and threw him stumbling through the wall before looking at his hands, like he was admiring his newfound strength.

Kai’s eyes then shifted to Bord, who was struggling with getting the upper hand with another security guard. The man Bord fought was bigger than him but showed no particular skills. He just attacked with a series of chaotic swings.

Although it looked like Bord was struggling, after observing for a while, Kai knew that he was simply waiting for an opening.

The security man had Bord in an arm lock, while their weapons clashed against each other.

Should be anytime now.

But over time, Bord’s energy remained the same. The opponent, however, started getting tired. His hands started shaking, along with his feet due to the position they were in— rather odd, and uncomfortable with their feet wide apart.

Kai’s eyes squinted as he stared at the arm lock loosening for a brief moment.

Bord pressed on his forearm and pushed him away in a swift notion. Turning around, the security guard bent and clung to his arm where Bord took the chance to kick him in the face with his knees.

The man stumbled back and fell to the floor.

Bord took that moment to cut through his ankle, earning a piercing shout from him.

In the middle of the scene, Killian swooped a man on his shoulders and slumped on the ground with a big thud, earning a few head turns.

Kai watched how he skillfully pressed his leg on the man’s chest, keeping him on the ground while the latter’s arm was locked as Killian stretched it upwards.

“Ahhhhh!!” The guy screamed in pain, tears streaming down his face.

Killian drew blood all over his wrists from his sword and pushed him to the ground, letting him clutch his hand and cry. He immediately went and started handling another security guard.

The castle guards were already handling the rest of the security guards and Killian’s eyes were focused on the guards he trained. He was barking orders left and right.

The number of guards who stayed and fought became lower.

Their main intention wasn’t to kill anyone but to make them wounded enough so that they wouldn’t be a problem when they were inside.

Twenty minutes passed by.

The guards of the Tradeheart Merchant company were lying on the floor, clutching their arms and legs.

Most were bleeding, while others certainly had bone and muscle fractures from the fight.

Kai stepped up from behind, passing all those who were on the ground. The city guards slowly fell behind.

His gaze swept across the scene.

He was in the reception area and other than the guards, there were quite a few huddled around.

Clerks, low-level merchants and other servants were in the corner, looking in between the security guards they had beaten and Kai.

They didn't seem to be important enough and froze when they saw the small army moving in.

Kai's eyes met one of the merchants for a fleeting moment.

Then, his voice cut through the stunned silence. "Excuse me," he said, his tone firm but polite, "Could someone point me towards the office of Erasmus Thorne?"

The question hung in the air.

A young clerk, no older than sixteen, his face pale with a mixture of fear and curiosity, hesitantly stepped forward. "U-upstairs, Lord Arzan," he stammered, pointing towards a grand staircase at the back of the room.

Kai inclined his head in acknowledgement, a flare of appreciation crossing his features. He gestured for Killian and his guards to follow, their footsteps echoing on the polished marble floor as they ascended the stairs.

The atmosphere changed drastically as they reached the upper floor.

Rich tapestries adorned the walls, and the muted thrum of conversation filtered through a set of double doors at the end of the hallway. They took the steps and started marching upstairs.

When they reached, a large oak door stood, leading to what he guessed was the boss's office.

Kai stopped in front of the doors, a knowing glint in his eyes.

Without hesitation, he pushed the doors open.

There sat Erasmus Thorne, the very picture of composure, behind a massive, ornately carved desk.

Galvan stood beside him, his face a mask of conflicting emotions.

Kai’s eyes locked with Erasmus, who leaned forward in his chair, a scowl etched on his face.

"Lord Arzan," he drawled, his voice laced with barely concealed disdain. "This is an unorthodox way to visit. Barging into a private office without an invitation is considered disrespectful in most circles."

Kai met Erasmus's scowl with a ruthless gaze of his own. "Disrespectful?" he countered. "Perhaps. But again, Mr. Thorne, this is my city. And these unexpected visits seem to be a recurring theme when it comes to Tradeheart."

Erasmus's nostrils flared with barely contained anger. He opened his mouth to retort, but Kai cut him off with a raised hand.

"Enough of this charade," Kai continued, his voice firm. "I'm not here for pleasantries. I'm here for business."

Erasmus leaned back in his chair, a glint of curiosity battling with his annoyance. "Business?" he echoed. "What kind of business?"

"The kind that settles outstanding debts," Kai declared, his gaze moving to the chest held by one of his guards. With a flick of his wrist, the chest lid snapped open, revealing a dazzling display of gold coins. 10,000 of them.

A collective gasp filled the room. Galvan's eyes widened in surprise, while Erasmus's facade faltered for a moment, a twinkle of greed momentarily replacing his anger.

"This," Kai continued, his voice ringing with authority, "is the repayment for the city's loan, in full and with immediate effect." He gestured towards the chest. "Have your agreement ready. I expect it to be signed and sealed before I leave these premises."

Erasmus stared at the gold, his mind racing. It was visible on his face that the abruptness of the situation, the sheer volume of the coin, was all too much to process for him. He opened and closed his mouth.

He glanced at Galvan, who met his gaze with a mixture of resignation.

"Tea, perhaps?" Erasmus finally offered, his voice strained. "We can discuss this matter over a cup of—"

"No time for pleasantries," Kai interrupted, his voice leaving no room for argument. "The agreement. Now."

Erasmus, sensing the shift in power dynamics, slumped back in his chair, a defeated sigh escaping his lips.

He reached into a drawer, pulling out a rolled-up scroll tied with a crimson ribbon.

He unfurled the scroll and quickly wrote a few things. After two minutes, Erasmus visibly sighed.

“Wait…” Kai’s voice came. “Francis.” They shared an unvoiced conversation.

Francis walked from behind and towards Erasmus’s desk. His eyes peaked over all the details of the paper. He tapped on the other set of papers that he had brought with him.

As he matched the contents of it, he repeatedly nodded.

Kai knew what it was. In time, everyone here will see and know how this would go down. He waited patiently.

All eyes were on Erasmus, who waited for Francis to finish reading what he wrote.

“Yes, you can sign that,” Francis’s approval lingered in the air. He then walked behind to stand behind the crowd.

This debt had been a powerful tool, a leash holding the city in a stranglehold. Now, with a single act, Kai was breaking it.

Erasmus dipped a quill in ink, his hand shaking slightly.

He glanced at the gold again, a storm of emotions pouring across his face. Then, his eyes lingered over to the guards standing beside him.

Galvan stood in the corner, looking helpless and Erasmus knew he wasn't going to get any help from him. He gulped and the quill moved.

After signing the papers that stated that the debt was paid in full, he passed it on to Kai who read over it before giving it to Francis to safeguard. With this, Tradeheart could never even hope to take the farmlands.

“Take it inside,” Erasmus ordered to the clerk who stood by his side the entire time.

The latter walked forward and took it behind the door.

"Well, Lord Arzan," he began, his voice dripping with a false cheer, "A most… unexpected turn of events. But a delightful one nonetheless! The city settling its debt in full is a great achievement. And those heat stones— a truly ingenious invention. Quite the boon for the city, I would say."

Kai raised an eyebrow, unfazed by Erasmus's attempt to butter him up. "Yes, indeed," he replied, his voice devoid of warmth. "The Heat stones have proven quite successful."

Erasmus leaned forward, a sly glint in his eyes. "Speaking of success, Lord Arzan, perhaps there's an opportunity for… collaboration. Tradeheart, as you know, has a vast network of connections. We could help expand the reach of these Heat stones, ensuring their distribution throughout the country! A mutually beneficial partnership, wouldn't you agree?"

Kai shook his head, a resolute glint in his eyes. "I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid a partnership with Tradeheart isn't in the cards."

Erasmus's smile faltered for a brief moment, a twitch of annoyance crossing his features. "Is this about the… debt settlement? I assure you, Lord Arzan, it was a simple business transaction. And I sincerely apologise if any offence was caused."

Kai held his gaze, his voice steady. "The debt is a matter of the past, Erasmus. However, there are other… concerns that make me avoid any such collaboration."

The latter steepled his fingers, his eyes narrowing. "Concerns? Do elaborate, Lord Arzan.

A tense silence took over the room. Kai met Erasmus's narrowed gaze head-on, a hint of a challenge dancing in his eyes. He gestured towards Francis, who stood stoically by the door now.

"Francis," Kai said, his voice low but firm, "bring in the files."

Francis walked forward with a thick stack of bound parchments. He placed them on the desk with a soft thud, the sound echoing in the strained silence.

"These files, Erasmus Thorne," Kai began, his voice carrying a quiet weight. "They detail a long and troubling history. Tradeheart Merchant Company has operated in our city for decades. While some of your contributions have been… beneficial, you cannot deny that you have consistently acted outside the bounds of fair trade.”

Erasmus's face remained a mask of confusion, though a flicker of unease across his features. Galvan, on the other hand, seemed oddly tense, his gaze flitting between Kai and the files on the desk.

Kai noticed how he hadn’t said a word since he got here. He had let Erasmus do all the talking— he guessed he hadn't forgotten the small sample he had shown him about laws the last time.

"Outside the bounds?" Erasmus scoffed. "What are you talking about, Lord Arzan?"

Francis stepped forward, his voice filled with an authority Kai would seldom hear. "These documents, Mr. Thorne, detail numerous violations of city ordinances. Price gouging during times of scarcity, manipulation of contracts, and even… questionable accounting practices."

Erasmus's face paled slightly. He glanced at Galvan, who bit his lip, his eyes filled with a mixture of fear and nervousness.

"These are… unfounded accusations," Erasmus stammered, his voice losing its earlier bravado.

Francis, unfazed, began to list specific instances: "The exorbitant prices charged for basic supplies during last harsh frost. The hidden clauses in contracts burdened farmers with unfair debts. And the discrepancies in your tax reports that suggest a significant amount of revenue has gone… unaccounted for."

Kai watched Francis methodically dismantle Tradeheart's facade. His voice, devoid of emotion, cut through the tense silence.

“I believe there’s more,” Kai said in a low tone. “Please, from the beginning, Francis. I’m sure the businessmen here would like to know everything they've done to violate the city rules.”

"Firstly," Francis began, tapping a document. "The issue of monopolies. Tradeheart, through a series of… forceful negotiations and strategic acquisitions, has gained an illegal monopoly on essential goods like wood and weapons. While the surface appears legitimate, we looked into it and found proof."

He flipped through the pages, his gaze shifting between them and Erasmus's increasingly pale face. "There were other merchants, smaller companies, who dared to compete in these markets. However, their attempts were short-lived."

Francis paused, letting the weight of his next words hang in the air. "Several caravans carrying weapons from these smaller merchants were attacked by bandits. After a thorough investigation, we discovered a pattern. The bandits involved were all linked back to… individuals with close ties to Tradeheart."

Erasmus's face drained of all colour, replaced by a chilling realisation. A strangled gasp escaped his lips, but he remained silent, unable to refute the accusation.

Francis continued, his voice relentless. "Furthermore, Mr. Thorne, there appears to be a significant discrepancy between your company's reported income and its actual expenditures. Our investigation reveals evidence of embezzlement of funds, a systematic syphoning of profits for… personal gain."

He reached into the stack of documents and pulled out a ledger, its pages filled with meticulous calculations. With a flourish, he placed it on the desk in front of Erasmus.

"These ledgers," Francis declared. "They detail a pattern of under-reporting revenue and inflated expenses. In essence, Tradeheart has been systematically avoiding its fair share of taxes, depriving the city of much-needed funds."

Erasmus stared at the ledger, his hands trembling slightly.

"How… how did you gather this information?" he stammered, his voice barely a whisper.

Kai met Erasmus's hollow eyes with a steely gaze. "Our investigation was thorough," he said, his voice betraying none of the satisfaction stirring within him. This is all what he has been preparing for quite some time. "We questioned several of your… former employees. It seems some found a conscience after witnessing the lengths Tradeheart was willing to go to maintain its stranglehold on the city."

Erasmus frowned.

He opened his mouth to speak, a desperate plea for leniency forming on his lips. However, before any words could escape, Kai cut him off with a raised hand.

"You can try to challenge our findings, Erasmus," Kai continued, his voice devoid of warmth. "You can fight us in court, waste what remains of your dwindling resources on a legal battle you're destined to lose."

Erasmus's shoulders slumped further, all fight seeming to drain from him.

"But," Kai continued, a hint of a challenge in his eyes. "Let me remind you of one final infraction, a transgression so egregious that even the most skilled lawyers will struggle to defend."

He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low growl. "The attack on a member of the nobility. Do you deny that a member of your so-called security detail trespassed onto my estate and assaulted me?"

Erasmus's head snapped, glancing at Galvan with a glare. "An unfortunate misunderstanding… It should be a misunderstanding," he sputtered. "Those guards were simply ensuring the safety of—"

"Misunderstandings do not explain a trained bodyguard launching an unprovoked attack," Kai interrupted, his voice laced with a dangerous edge. "And the law is quite clear. An assault on a member of the nobility is a serious offence, punishable by imprisonment. Considering the evidence of Tradeheart's activities, I would say that could extend to everyone associated with your organisation."

The air filled with tension. One could cut it through with a knife without a doubt.

A stunned silence followed Kai's pronouncement. Erasmus's head whipped towards Galvan, his eyes wide with a mixture of betrayal and fury. "Galvan!" he roared, his voice cracking. "Is this true?! Did your guard really attack him?!"

Galvan looked down at his clasped hands, shame etched on his face. "I… I apologised that day itself, boss. It was in the heat of the moment," he mumbled. "It was wrong."

Erasmus's face contorted in rage.

“That doesn’t mean a grain if there were witnesses! What have you done?!!”

Before he could unleash another tirade, Kai cut him off with a cold glare.

“You all can fight in jail later on.” He frowned at them.

He gestured towards Killian and his guards. "Arrest them all," he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument.

The guards surged forward, their movements swift and practised.

Galvan, shame glistening in his eyes, offered no resistance. The other employees of Tradeheart, their faces pale with fear, froze in place.

Erasmus, however, wasn't ready to surrender so easily. He scrambled to his feet, a desperate plea clinging to his voice. "Wait!" he sputtered. "There must be a misunderstanding! We can negotiate! We have resources! We can—"

Kai spoke up. "Negotiations are over. The evidence speaks for itself. These charges will be sent to the capital, and Tradeheart will be branded enemies of the nobility. Until a proper trial takes place, you will all remain in custody."

Erasmus's face crumpled like a discarded parchment. His eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape, a glimmer of hope. But there was none.

As the guards began to escort the Tradeheart personnel away, Erasmus let out a strangled cry of protest. "This is outrageous! You can't do this! I demand a trial! We have rights!"

His pleas fell on deaf ears.

Kai watched him being led away, a jerk of satisfaction tinged in his mind.

This is what happens when you do unforgivable things.

He did everything to make sure that he left evidence of what happens when someone misbehaves under his rule. He made sure that everyone on the street gets to see that even the most powerful can be brought to their knees.

Throughout the way back to the castle, the protests and pleas filled the street’s air.

A note from Extra26





Modern Patriarch (Book 1 Stubbed)





Book 1 is available on Amazon here

Audiobook narrated by Ralph Lister who has also narrated Malazan and Mage Errant!



* * *



When Yao Shen, Patriarch of the Heavenly Sky Sect, ascends and regains memories of his past life on Planet Earth, he realizes that he can no longer allow himself to accept the cruel and violent ways of Eliria, the realm of cultivation.

So he decides to change it.

It was time to found a new sect. One based on the values of honor and equality over senseless violence and discrimination. A sect where all, from the mortal farmer’s son to a sect elder's daughter, were held accountable to the same rules.

Welcome to the Modern Sect.





```





Kai’s expectations came true.

After he dragged Erasmus out in the street, the whole town knew that Kai paid off the debt and dealt with the Tradeheart Merchant company.

And with that, the headquarters were deserted. Even the low-level clerks left the city behind, not wanting to get caught and being scared of actions against them.

It wasn’t something major to care about, as Kai’s main intention was to state his authority to the public. Every organisation in the city and neighbouring states knew not to mess with him without a second thought due to that.

It was just the start— but regardless, it was a start. The other necessary things that were needed to do to get the economy of the city running again were at the back of his list.

One of those included the mines.

Kai had been watching them for quite some time. He received the information about the bandit group who occupied the mine.

Therefore, after recruiting guards, he was finally ready to take it on.

Kai’s shoulders were released from the taut position, while he let out a deep breath. They were in an office room where Killian and the guards gathered to discuss a few matters which included the bandits.

"Well done, everyone," he said, his voice gruff. He smiled, showing appreciation to everyone. "A swift and decisive victory. Tradeheart won't be troubling us any time soon."

The guards puffed up their chests with proud smiles on their faces. Killian nodded his head. “It was all due to your commands, Lord Arzan."

Kai offered Killian a small, genuine smile. "Everyone played the part. Now, let's turn our attention to more pressing matters." He gestured towards a large map spread out on the table, its surface dominated by the sprawling network of tunnels that snaked beneath the city— the mines.

"These bandits we need to deal with," Kai began, his voice turning serious. "They seem to be operating from a specific location within the mines." He pointed to a heavily shaded area on the map, a cluster of crudely drawn structures marking a small settlement.

"According to our observations," Francis added, his voice devoid of emotion as he traced a path with his finger. "There's a small worker settlement there and the bandits are using it a makeshift housing for themselves and people they have captured as slaves. There are watchtowers erected, giving them a clear view of any approaching threat. They were there to look out for any monsters, but now, it's a huge advantage for the bandits."

A frown creased Kai's brow as he studied the map. "Slaves?" he echoed, his voice hardening. "It seems these bandits aren't just interested in harassing travellers."

"Yes, Lord Arzan," Killian confirmed, his gaze fixed on the map. “There’s been reports that they have captured people from nearby villagers, mostly women. There's also a few miners who weren't able to run away when they attacked the mines.”

Kai didn't have to think twice about what they were doing with the slaves. His rage rekindled as the discussion continued.

“They have been trying to mine there and ship it out to other places for good coin,” Francis said. “Though, it's been slow since no one wants to deal with them. Anyone doing so would automatically break the kingdom's law.”

Kai looked at the map with curious eyes.

He couldn't help but think about the leader of this bandit group— a man known only as "Grekk the Pulverizer."

“Grekk the Pulverizer… That’s how he’s being called, right?” He asked, tilting his head, finding the title strange and amusing.

“Yes, he leads the Black Ravens.” Killian frowned as he talked about the leader of them, “Grekk isn't just a mindless thug. He had a history of being an intelligent individual and a history of violence. More than that, he had worked in the army where he got good battle experience. He fought in the 2nd Dark Rose War. But the guy was thrown out for war crimes,” Killian said and paused before continuing, “He was rumoured to kill a subordinate, simply because he couldn’t control his anger, and abused women against their own will in villages. Both cases were reported. So, he was kicked out. Part of the reason was also because he punched a superior right in the face.”

A moment of silence was passed between everyone.

“Even if he had been in the army, he sure had the guts to go after a noble's territory. A power-hungry guy who can't think far into the future.” Kai broke the silence and nodded, tracing the route to the bandit settlement with his finger.

He had seen individuals like him a lot. There was more than one case of protectors of a city doing more heinous crimes than even the worst prisoners, just due to their lust for power and authority.

“This wouldn't be a simple raid.”

He traced the path to the bandit settlement with his finger, a grim realisation settling on his features. His lips pursed to a thin line as he sighed— Killian's briefing painted a disturbing picture in his mind.

"Once he got out, he started The Black Ravens with a hundred bandits under him. Over half had been in the army while others were taken from small bandit groups," Killian rumbled, continuing on the origins of the guy. "Most of them past their prime, more belly than brawn, but veterans nonetheless. They wouldn't win a stand-up fight, but they have lived in the settlement for months now. And they're ruthless."

He hesitated for a moment, his jaw clenching. "And there's the matter of the… women." Disgust coloured his voice as he spoke of the kidnapped villagers forced to serve the bandits. “The villagers tried to fight, but it’s been tough with the command being non-existent.”

Kai barely controlled his mana from flaring up. The prisoners would be a big problem. He didn't want them to get caught up in their plans.

“We need to pull up our forces. It's not going to be easy, but we are going to make a statement out of them." Kai’s voice grew colder with every word.

Killian nodded curtly. "Agreed, Lord Arzan. But how strong a force are we talking about?"

Kai's gaze swept across the room, taking in the determined faces of the guards. They were front-line guards who were trained to work closely with Killian.

"We bring half our forces," Kai said. "Fifty well-trained guards, myself, and you, Killian. That should be enough to crack Grekk's little fiefdom and send those bandits scattering like frightened roaches."

A hint of a smile played on Killian's lips. He chuckled— a dry, humourless sound. "Half our forces, Lord Arzan? With all due respect, that's overkill. You alone could probably handle half those bandits."

Kai raised an eyebrow, a surprised glint in his eyes. "While I appreciate the vote of confidence, Killian, underestimating our enemy is a recipe for disaster."

"Not in this case," Killian countered, his voice firm. "These bandits are a disorganised lot. Nasty, certainly, but far from the toughest opponents we've faced. Remember the necromancer incident last year? Compared to that, this will be a walk in the park."

"True," he admitted. “But complacency is a danger too. We can't afford to get sloppy."

At least not when we know that Grekk is trained in an army and would pull up anything to keep us away. Kai thought to himself and looked at Killian.

Killian straightened up, his gaze sweeping across the room, meeting the determined eyes of his companions. "Very well, then I suggest we'll take a smaller yet stronger force – forty of our best guards, myself, and you, Lord Arzan. That should be enough to send a message."

A collective murmur of agreement rippled through the room. Forty elite guards, with Kai by their side. It seemed possible by how Killian explained their situation.

Kai turned towards the guards, his voice hardening with resolve. "Men," he boomed, his voice echoing in the room. "For too long, these bandits have plagued our lands, harassing travellers and stealing from our people. They have grown comfortable in their arrogance, believing they can run rampant on our soil with impunity."

His gaze burned with righteous anger. "But today, that ends. Today, we show them the true meaning of pride and honour. Today, we reclaim what is rightfully ours! We march into those mines not just to liberate the innocent, but to send a message. A message that says our city will not tolerate those who seek to exploit and plunder!"

In the end, he smirked, “They’ll be paying with their lives.”

The guards cheered loudly, excited by what Kai had in mind.

***

Ansel, a man who sat to the side of the road wiped his brow with a grimy sleeve, taking a long swig from his waterskin.

His throat felt like sandpaper, and his lips were cracked and bleeding. It had been too cold for him to continue walking for a long time.

A few more hours, he thought, squinting towards the horizon.

The city of Veralt should be just around the next bend, according to the sketchy map he'd bartered for in the last village.

He'd heard rumours about Veralt— once a prosperous city, it had turned desolate after the last lord had passed away and the new one wasn't interested in the matter of governance.

With bandit attacks and a migrating population, it was supposed to turn into a ghost city sooner or later.

But lately, those whispers had taken a hopeful turn.

Talk of a new leader, a Mage who had driven out the merchants and was cleaning house.

Ansel wasn't one for believing rumours, but he was a traveller and it was his life path to visit every place. With everything surrounding Veralt, it just felt like the right place for his next destination.

Maybe he could even find something interesting enough to hold his attention there.

He hoisted himself up from the shade of the gnarled tree, wincing at the protest from his aching muscles. It's time to get back on the road.

Just as he reached for his horse's reins, a faint sound caught his attention— a rhythmic thudding—hooving in the distance.

He squinted, his hand hovering in mid-air. The sound grew steadily louder, accompanied by a low rumble that vibrated through the ground.

His heart hammered against his ribs. What in the world…?

Curiosity warring with caution, he decided to investigate. He tethered his horse to a low-hanging branch and crept towards a rise in the ground that offered a better vantage point.

As he crested the small hill, his breath hitched.

There, on the dusty road below, a sight unfolded that sent a jolt of adrenaline through him.

A group of quite a large number of people, clad in gleaming armour, galloped their way through the street, their expressions grim and determined.

In the middle—surrounded by the rest of the guards, two figures gained his attention for how differently they were dressed. One was a tall, imposing man with an air of authority, the other an armoured man who had a mysterious aura surrounding him.

Are those guards? But, where are they headed?

Ansel's jaw dropped as he couldn’t believe his eyes. There were a lot of them, and it wasn’t a usual sight for him.

He felt a deep urge to turn and flee, to disappear back into the anonymity of the dusty road.

But a strange sense of fascination kept him rooted to the spot. He watched, mesmerised, as the army marched on.

I wish I could see where they’re headed.

Ansel scrambled back from the road, his heart hammering against his ribs. He was galloping on his own horse towards the guards who were moving steadily— he had to double their speed to catch up.

When he finally reached the front, he went a bit forward, towards the middle of the road. The guards halted in their way— a hollow silence filled the air.

He got down from his horse and looked up at the towering figure who quickly made his way towards Ansel.

A hand, encased in a heavy gauntlet, pointed towards him. He seemed like a guard.

"Out of the way, you!" the guard boomed, his voice laced with urgency. “You’re in our way," the guard growled. "Move along."

Ansel stammered, his voice barely a whisper. "I-I apologise. I'm just a traveller. On my way to Veralt."

The guard's gaze softened slightly. “If that's the case, then just go there." He glanced behind, turning his head to look at the city’s direction. “We guard the city. Just go on and the guards on the gate will let you in.”

“Thanks, but I have a question for you,” he asked, the guard cocking his head in curiosity. A part of him told him to not bother them, but he wanted to know. "What's going on?" he blurted. "Where are you all headed?"

The guard hesitated, then leaned. "We're heading to the mines. Lord Arzan himself is leading the charge." He puffed out his chest and looked behind. “You should get off of our way. We don't have much time, so just be on your way.”

Ansel nodded, yet continued to talk. "I apologise for another question but are you… are you heading to deal with the bandits?"

The guard's eyes narrowed. "Bandits?" he echoed, suspicion creeping into his voice. "How did you know about that?"

Ansel flushed. “I just overheard a merchant group talking. Apparently, it's a famous topic to discuss among them," he said, trying to act casual.

The guard's gaze remained fixed on him for a long, tense moment. Just as Ansel was about to turn and bolt before he could run out of patience, the guard relaxed slightly. “It sure is something those gossip-loving bastards would love to discuss." He muttered.

Seeing an opening, Ansel pressed his luck. "Yes, I was travelling with them and they talked about all sorts of stuff like bored housewives. So… are you heading there? To the bandits, I mean?" He gestured vaguely towards the horses. “If so, can you let me come with you?”

Ansel requested.

A hand, adorned with a simple silver ring, suddenly descended upon the guard's shoulder.

The guard straightened, surprise flickering across his face as he turned to address the newcomer. The imposing figure Ansel had seen in the middle of the guards dismounted from his horse, his armour already giving him hints about his standing.

He was a man of impressive stature. The guard immediately bowed to his presence. Ansel frowned.

"What seems to be the problem here?" the newcomer inquired, his voice surprisingly gentle despite his imposing presence.

The guard, his posture still stiff with respect, explained the situation. "Lord Arzan," he began, inclining his head slightly. "We found this traveller on the road. He seems to be aware of our mission and expressed a desire to… accompany us. I didn’t say that it’s possible, but it’s certainly up to you, my Lord."

The guard took a step back, letting Lord Arzan handle it.

So, that is… Lord Arzan. He looked better than what I heard about him previously.

Ansel, suddenly aware of the man's importance, managed to speak out, "I wouldn't want to be a bother, my lord. Just a simple traveller, heading to Veralt. I heard about the… situation with the bandits, and I, well, I wouldn't mind observing from a safe distance."

Lord Arzan's gaze swept over Ansel, taking in his dusty clothes and worn satchel. Something flickered in his eyes. "Observe, you say?" he rumbled. "This is no sightseeing expedition. These bandits are ruthless men, and this is no place for the faint of heart."

Ansel’s mouth moved to counter it as he was certainly no “faint of heart” and could hold off against a few bandits, but Lord Arzan cut him off with a decisive shake of his head.

"No," he declared, his voice firm. "For your own safety, you cannot accompany us. I believe you can find your way to Veralt. The city is good and warm to travellers. Go and do whatever business you have there."

He turned towards the guards, his expression hardening. “We need to move out. If anyone else disturbs the road, let them know the same."

The guards acknowledged the order with a sharp nod, their gazes lingering on Ansel for a moment.

He felt a pang of disappointment as seeing the guards in action would have been a nice sight. It certainly interested him more than seeing the city and finding an inn to stay.

As the riders turned their mounts and thundered away, a cloud of dust swirled to the sky as the horses galloped in a flash.

He watched them go, a strange mix of emotions churning within him. Then, he smiled, pulling out his horse and taking off.

***

The relentless coldness beat down on Kai and his companions as they travelled the vast expanse of grasslands.

Hours had bled into one another since they had left the city gates, the rhythmic pounding of hooves a constant thrumming in their ears.

Sweat beaded on their brows, soaking their armour.

Despite the heat and fatigue, a tense focus hung in the air. Kai, at the head of the formation, scanned the horizon with a practised eye.

Gone were the lush forests and winding roads of the outskirts; here, the land stretched out before them in a sea of tall grasses, rippling gently in the breeze.

Killian rode beside him, his face etched with grim determination. "Any sign of them yet, Lord Arzan?" he rumbled, his voice hoarse from the chill air.

Kai knew he pointed his question at him due to him using [Hawk Eyes] to keep an eye on where they were headed.

He shook his head, his lips pursed in concentration. "Not yet," he replied, his voice low. "But according to the map, the settlement shouldn't be far. I should be able to see it-" He gestured towards a faint smudge on the horizon, barely seeing it due to the distance. "See that? That could be the dust plume from their mining operations. Get down!”

Killian made a noise that halted all the guards in their positions.

If the settlements were close by, it wasn’t the most ideal or smart to go to them on horses.

In a swift moment, they were all on their feet while the guards took control of the horses.

Killian looked back and whistled.

The guards bent down slightly after tying them to the trees and started moving in a herd.

“Slowly,” Killian said aloud for only the front line to hear, but the rest of the guards took alert.

The anticipation crackled in the air, thick and suffocating. They were nearing their target, and the unknown dangers that lurked within the mines gnawed at their nerves.

Soon, they saw the first sign of the settlement with the towers built like a fortress to not let any monsters close. From the distance, Kai could already spot a few bandits on top of them.

Killian straightened."Are we sure about this plan, Lord Arzan?" he asked, his voice barely a whisper. "Hitting them head-on seems… risky."

A flicker of a smile touched Kai's lips. "Risky, yes," he admitted. "But a surprise is our greatest advantage. If we can overwhelm them quickly, before they have time to react, we can minimise casualties."

Killian pressed close to Kai, his voice a tense whisper. "How do we handle this? Those towers… they'll spot us the second we break cover." His eyes flicked to the rough-hewn settlement, a knot of concern appearing on his face.

Kai knew he had a point. The bandits could easily see from the security post that they were nearing the land they occupied. But he already had a plan to deal with it.

“Don't worry, I know what to do.”

They continued to slowly move forward, attempting not to make any big noises in the process. Their training seemed to be very useful as they hid behind trees and made sure there wasn’t anything suspicious moving around.

A few minutes passed in silence. The only noise Kai heard was his own heart beating against his ears.

Finally, they reached a clearing, a bowl of open land rimmed by skeletal trees. It was far enough that the bandits couldn't see them.

"I need your best archers. Right now."

Killian nodded and signalled, and a handful of figures melted from the shadows– archers with their bows strung tautly.

They had already discussed the guards' skills they should bring along, and archers were among them. The archers barely took a second to stand in front of Kai.

Perfect, he thought to himself as he saw how ready the five archers were. Their bows were gracefully held in their hands, and they were prepared to release to shoot at an order.

"See them?" Kai asked, pointing at the tower.

Killian squinted, finally making out the dark shapes huddled atop the towers, barely more than smudges against the fading daylight.

"Can you hit them?" Kai asked, his voice low, the question hanging in the air.

A chorus of negatives followed. "Too far, Lord Arzan," one archer muttered, squinting towards the distant towers. "Can't even make out the details, let alone a target that small."

Another chimed in, his voice laced with frustration. "The wind is picking up, my Lord. Long-range shots like that are a gamble at best."

Kai listened patiently, his expression unreadable. Then, a slow smile spread across his face, a glint dancing in his eyes.

"What if I told you where to aim?" he asked. "Not just where, but how high to hold your bow, the exact number of degrees to adjust for the wind… all of it."

Silence spread.

The archers exchanged uncertain glances. This was unorthodox. Targeting wasn't a precise science, it relied on experience and a keen eye. But then there was Lord Arzan's image for them. Kai knew that he wasn't known for recklessness recently, and his spells were unmatched in the minds of the guards.

The guards had started to trust him even more— so this should put all of it to the test.

Finally, one of the archers stepped forward. He looked to be a seasoned veteran with his hair in the process of fading to white and a few wrinkles covering his face. "You sure about this, Lord Arzan?" he rumbled, his voice gruff.

Kai met his gaze unflinchingly. "Positive," he declared with certainty. "But it has to be perfect. One shot, one kill."

The veteran archer studied him for a long moment, then a slow nod followed. "Alright, Lord Arzan," he said, a low determination settling in his voice. "Tell us what you see, and we'll do the rest."

The archer’s approval was the only thing Kai needed.

Kai squinted his eyes towards the distant watchtowers. He raised a gloved hand, silencing the murmurs of his men.

They were probably discussing the plan and if it was even going to work.

“Hold,” he commanded.

Then, he whispered the incantation, a faint blue light coming from his fingertips. It swirled for a brief moment before changing into a miniature hawk.

If flapped his wings as everyone looked in surprise before taking off.

It was a 2nd circle spell which was a more complicated and advanced version of [Hawk Eyes]. It was called [Vision of Hawk] and was perfect for what Kai needed at the moment.

The hawk's images became invisible as soon as it hit the air. Kai started focusing on his connection with the hawk, his vision sharpening as if mirroring the hawk’s keen eyesight.

Within a few seconds, he saw the bandits with startling clarity—one, a hulking figure with a scared face leaning against the rail. And then, he saw another person who paced restlessly, a crossbow slung across his back.

As he squinted, he was able to see more details. The weathered wood, a worn rope ladder leading up to the platform where the bandits were. He could see everything— even three more bandits at different points on the tower.

The next step was doing another complicated 1st circle spell. It was called [Ranging Strand]. Complications lay in its spell structure and the purpose, and it was mostly used to accurately measure distance, and the degrees of angles the archers had to aim.

If even a small degree changes, it will affect their entire plan on a major scale. The spell started working, allowing Kai to take all the measurements in degrees.

Hmm. Kai mentally studied everything he saw while combining the spells with his efforts. Using two spells at the same time was almost impossible for most new Mages, but it was second nature for him, even though it took a lot of concentration.

"Alright," he announced, his voice carrying a note of quiet confidence. "I have the lay of the land. Now, listen closely…"

Kai's gaze narrowed as he lowered his hand, the lingering blue wisp of magic from the Ranging Strand dissipating into the air. A satisfied smile tugged at the corner of his lips.

He gestured towards the veteran archer, the one with the weathered face. "So," he addressed him. "You take the first shot. Aim for the eastern lookout, just to the right of that weathered beam. Just get into position and I will help correct it."

The guy didn't flinch. He stepped forward, no questions asked. With practised movements, he knocked an arrow, his gaze fixed on the distant tower. He adjusted the angle of his bow ever so slightly.

Kai helped him get his bow to the correct length, measuring the distance and the angle.

“Is this enough?” the guy whispered.

“Three to five degrees more… Perfect,” Kai said.

A deep breath in, a slow exhale, and the string sang as he loosed the arrow.

It flew true, a dark streak against the clear sky. A tense silence followed, broken only by the sighing wind.

Then, from the direction of the watchtower, a bloodcurdling scream pierced the air.

It was a sound of raw pain and surprise. The cry was so loud that Kai saw the man immediately standing up with his hand on his chest, where the arrow hit him.

Within a second, he fell on the floor.

One shot, one kill.

Wasting no time, Kai barked out another order. "Second archer, southern lookout. One and a half heartbeats. Take your aim!"

The second archer stepped forward, his movements mirroring the previous guy. He drew, aimed, and loosened. Another cry, this one tinged with fury, echoed across the empty land.

The third archer aimed his arrow and waited for Kai’s command.

“Tilt up to the East from the second guy. One heartbeat, take your aim.”

The archer acted along.

“Four degrees to the left, and two down—” Kai paused. “And.. Shoot.”

The archer stretched the bow and shot instantly, earning another scream. The last two archers had similar responses as they successfully cleared the watchers from every tower.

Perfection.

“That’d be all for now!” Kai’s hurried voice came in a whisper. Although a sense of satisfaction clouded over his thoughts, he couldn’t let it empower his actions.

“Good job, you five,” Killian’s voice came from behind; a proud tone clearly audible.

Kai shook his head immediately. “It’s just the beginning. Let’s head back to the horses as soon as possible. We need to strike them when they least expect it!”

***

A massive wooden table groaned under the weight of a feast prepared for a burly, untidy man.

Trencher boards overflowed with roasted boar, glistening slabs of ribs and an entire side of salmon baked to a golden crisp. In the centre, a steaming bowl of stew sent tendrils of savoury aroma wafting through the air.

At the head of the table, a man built like a bull sat hunched over, shovelling food into his mouth with a ferocity that rivalled a starving wolf.

Greased fingers tore at roasted chicken, grease dripping down his worn leather jerkin and staining his thick beard. That was Grekk, the self-proclaimed leader of the Black Raven Bandits.

Across from him, a wiry man named Fletch picked at his food with a chipped plate with nervous tics and darting eyes.

He was the closest thing Grekk had to an advisor, though his role leaned more towards suggestions than actual strategy.

"Blast it all!" Grekk roared, slamming his meaty fist on the table, sending a platter of vegetables clattering to the floor. "These mines are overflowing with good ore, enough to line our pockets for years! But what good is it if we can't sell the damned stuff?"

Fletch winced at the outburst. "Well, boss," he stammered. "You know most merchants won't touch anything mined by bandits. It's bad for business, brings down the law and whatnot."

Grekk snorted, a spray of gravy escaping his beard. "Law? We make our own law here at Black Raven. Find some... unofficial channels, Fletch. Someone desperate enough to turn a blind eye for the right price."

Fletch chewed his lip, his eyes darting around the room as if searching for escape routes. "Tried that already, boss. Blacksmiths in the nearby towns won't touch it, and the whispers are the lord had put out an alert for anyone seen dealing with us."

Grekk's scowl deepened, his gaze darkening. He wiped his greasy hands on his breeches, leaving behind a glistening brown stain. "And what about that smooth-talker we were supposed to meet? Said he had connections, could get our ore into the black market without a hitch."

Fletch's throat constricted. "About that, boss… Well, he hasn't shown up since yesterday. Sent a couple of the men to check on his place, but it was empty. No sign of him, not a single coin."

Grekk's face contorted in a rage. He had talked to someone who had guaranteed to sell the ores and left with an advance, but he had just gotten scammed.

He lunged forward in anger, sending the table crashing to the floor with a deafening clang.

Plates shattered, cutlery scattered, and the stew pot rolled across the room, spewing its contents onto the rough-hewn wooden floor.

"Double-crossed!" Grekk yelled, his voice shaking the rafters. "We get robbed by a smooth-talking snake and can't even sell our own loot! Someone's going to pay for this!"

The retort died on Fletch's lips. He wondered what to do when something took his attention.

A guttural yell, laced with raw terror, pierced the air from outside. It was a sound they both recognized— the panicked cry of a man.

“What the hell is that?!”

Grekk shoved himself upright, his face a mask of fury instantly replaced by a cold, predatory gleam. He snatched an axe leaning against the wall.

Fletch scrambled to his feet, a dagger clutched in his sweating hand.

They didn't need words.

With a shared look, they surged towards the rough-hewn wooden door leading out onto the balcony.

Grekk threw open the door with a crash.

A wave of cool evening air washed over them, carrying with it the acrid smell of blood.

Grekk's breath caught in his throat.

Below, sprawled across the dusty path leading to the mine entrance, lay the lifeless forms of his men. Each bandit, the lookouts stationed on the other watchtowers included, sported a single, neat arrow protruding from their bodies.

No struggle, no cries of alarm, just silent death. His eyes widened at the precision of the arrow that pierced their bodies, making them lose blood and die.

Panic prickled at the edges of Grekk's mind.

He looked up, trying to find where the arrows came from.

There, in the distance, he saw them.

A company of soldiers, clad in gleaming armour, galloped on top of horses towards the mine entrance, led by a figure in silver that radiated an aura of quiet authority.

“Fletch, is that Arzan, the new lord of Veralt?” Grekk yelled, looking at his advisor.

He'd heard whispers of Arzan. And even sent one of his men to spy in the city whenever the lord would come out, so he knew how he looked and the man in the silver armour matched every one bit of the description.

“I-I think so.” Fletch nodded.

The realization of an attack hit both of them with the force of a hammer blow.

"Fletch, we need to do something!" Grekk bellowed, his voice hoarse with urgency. "We need to close the main gate! Now!"

He knew the gate wouldn't hold for long, but it might just buy them enough time to formulate a desperate plan, or at least a chance to fight.

Grekk could hear their hooves, loud and clear. For a brief moment, he couldn’t think of what to do.

“You! You! Close the damn gates!!!” Grekk yelled at a bandit on the lowest floor. It was the only way in or out of the settlement.

The bandit, eager to keep his life started closing the door. But soon, a deep guttural sound echoed through the land, followed by a deafening boom that shook the very foundations of the tower.

The door blasted away, making the bandit fly out and smash against a wall.

Grekk squinted his eyes.

Through the smoke and debris, Arzan stormed through. He dismounted his horse with a fluid moment.

A bandit came running towards him, but he kicked him with ease. The bandit fell to the ground, knocked out.

He didn’t make a single sound, simply lying unconscious on the floor.

The remaining men stared at the scene in stunned silence.

"Kill them all!" Arzan's voice rang out, cutting through the din. "Show no mercy to these bandits!"

The soldiers cheered loudly and dismounted their horses before rushing at the bandits, holding their weapons.

Two bandits charged at the noble.

Before Grekk could even blink, Arzan reacted instinctively. He unleashed a wind spell— Wait what?!

The bandits were sent tumbling through the air like ragdolls. They landed a few feet away, stunned and coughing.

Arzan moved his head, searching for something and his gaze turned cold when he noticed Grekk. In his outstretched hand, something flickered.

Within the speed of light, he sent a thin sharp layer of wind towards the two bandits, splitting their heads from their bodies. The blood started oozing out their necks as they fell onto the ground.

Grekk took two steps back.

"M-mage! There's a Mage among them! Lord Arzan is a Mage!"

"It's true! They weren't just rumours!" Fletch yelled as the noises of silver against one another filled the settlement.

"Doesn't matter!" Grekk said, trying to maintain a facade of bravado. "We have them outnumbered! We can't lose this mine! He is still a coward who didn’t do anything for them for months!" He said the last few words to himself and got to his feet.

He tightened his hold around the axe and started moving down the ladder.

Grekk had to be quick. Many of his men lay dead or dying at the soldiers' feet. But still, the rest of the men were trying to fight. He had to aid them and kill the Mage.

He quickly came down, his feet speeding up.

Once he hit the floor, his gaze swept across the guards.

***

Kai saw the man who seemed too unhealthy to his liking set his feet on the battleground. The way he was dressed, and how he darted his eyes in between the scenery— it was obvious to know his identity.

The burly man immediately started attacking two soldiers, but he knew the guards were capable.

Good luck, Grekk the Pulverizer.

Kai scoffed and turned around, sending a [Wind Spear] cutting a bandit’s air out as he tried to lunge towards him.

They were easy— too easy. Killian was right about this.

His men were trying their best to battle against them and a lot of them overpowered the bandits. But there were times they needed his help.

Feroy, who was a few feet away from Kai lifted a man in the air. His face turned red as all the blood rushed upwards. The man yelled in pain as Feroy sliced through his very chest, blood dripping all over him in the process.

“You darn bandit!” Feroy yelled.

He threw the man across the floor, adding to the pile of bandits he had killed so far.

Feroy didn't waste time admiring his handiwork.

The clang of metal on metal drew his gaze as the bandit with the short sword lunged.

Feroy met the attack head-on, his own spear a blur of silver. Sparks flew as blades clashed.

The bandit with the spiked club, a hulking brute with a shaved head, roared and swung his weapon in a wide arc.

Feroy ducked under the blow with practised ease. With a grunt, he slammed his shoulder into the bandit's chest, sending him staggering back.

The third bandit, wielding a spear saw it as an opening. He lunged forward. Feroy pivoted on his heel. He pushed the bandit again with great force. His strength was unmatched.

The bandit with the spear stumbled back in surprise, dragging himself due to imbalance and falling on the floor with a loud thud. Feroy didn't hesitate.

He charged forward. The bandit with the short sword, momentarily distracted, saw the attack too late. Feroy's blade found its mark, the bandit crumpling to the floor with a strangled cry. Blood dripped from the stab as he lay on the floor.

The remaining two bandits stared at the dead bandit. He didn't give them a chance to react. With a roar, he stomped his foot, gaining their attention. The bandit with the spiked club started taking a few steps backwards.

Before he could fully walk away, Feroy was upon him, his spear flashing down in a decisive arc.

The last bandit, the one with the spear, threw down his weapon with a whimper, his face drained of colour. Bord was behind him, his sword inside the man’s throat.

Feroy didn't even look at him, he turned and rushed to attack the next bandit. Bord simply shrugged and did the same.

Kai nodded at Bord who helped Feroy as he was almost worried he couldn’t handle three bandits together, but the guy proved him wrong.

Hollow moans from the bandit at hand soon brought him back to the present as another bandit rushed at him, throwing up his spear at him like a Lance.

Kai didn't have to do much as the wind blasted off the spear before another [Wind Spear] cut off the head of the bandit.

As the body fell to the ground almost instantly, he saw Bran and Nelson fighting off five bandits themselves.

Nelson was using his height and mass, throwing bandits flying on the ground. He was a tall guy, and including the power of awakening, he easily took on bandits as if they were mere flies, not even humans.

Bran took the chance to slide in between bandits and find those who were thrown by Nelson and lay on the floor. With ease, he silenced them with his sword.

Soon, the duo started fighting with more bandits head-to-head. They weren't entirely used to it. But Kai noticed how in sync they were.

“Argh!” His vision was swiftly disturbed by a tall, skinny man holding an axe twice the size of his head. Kai could say the skinny fellow was prepared to put up a fight. But before the bandit could even get closer to him, a trained soldier came from behind, slicing his sword right through his chest.

Kai threw a [Fire Bolt] at the man on the floor. Immediately, the smell of burnt flesh filled the air. Soon, he saw something else.

One of the guards was in a compromising situation. He was fighting off a bandit, but the second bandit had his axe in the air, almost getting to the guard.

I need to do something!

Kai quickly formed a spell structure on his hands. He used [Wind spear] once more and shot it towards the bandit.

It flew through the air and sliced his body into two. With the bandits being powerless against his spells, it was a pretty easy victory.

As he flung out his spells, he heard footsteps behind him. Turning back, he saw a bandit rushing at him slowly with a spiked club.

“I'm going to take your head, you bastard!” He yelled as he saw Kai.

“Are you sure about that?”

Without answering, the latter lunged at Kai, but he didn’t even give him enough time to get closer to him. He sent a [Fire Bolt].

The bandit’s loud-pitched cry pierced through the air as he dodged one bolt, but another hit his throat, burning the area around his neck as blood spurted out, ending his life slowly as he whimpered.

Fluidly, Kai turned around.

Taking one after another bandit, the fight continued.

The soldiers were outnumbering the bandits quickly for obvious reasons.

Kai was using simple spells left and right. Slicing through their body parts, distracting them, then killing them. It was an easy process, but every bandit was different.

Some were weaker than others.

Soon, a hulking brute with a spiked club launched at him. He didn't have time to form a spell structure, so he picked up his spear and immediately started deflecting a flurry of blows.

Sweat beaded on Kai’s brow as the bandit got ahead of himself. Kai caught his arm and twisted it, using the technique he had learned to fracture the bandit’s hands.

Even if the bandit was huge, Kai could see that he had unnecessary weight and had been fighting for a long time. So, it was easier than expected.

The man yelped in pain.

Then Kai used [Gust], sending the bandit flying in the air, followed by a [Wind spear] killing him in the air itself.

Killian on the other hand was fighting with a bandit who was swinging his club wildly. Kai rushed at him and saw his chance. He ducked under and delivered a swift kick to the bandit’s knee. The man buckled, collapsing with a pained grunt.

Killian killed the man with ease as his sword plunged his throat.

“Good technique, Lord Arzan,” Killian gave a respectful nod and continued to attack other bandits.

A painful yelp took his attention and Kai looked at the far end, around the stairs. A burly man's expression turned into a scowl as he took out his axe from the stomach of a guard.

He fell on the ground as the bandit— Grekk grinned before he turned, his eyes meeting Kai.

"Mage! I don’t care if you are the lord of the place. This place is mine now and no one can take it away from me," Grekk shouted, his voice laced with a desperate edge. “I will kill you first and then, your men will surrender to me!"

Kai didn't reply. Because the man was simply in denial.

What a self-centered arrogant bastard!

He frowned as Grekk made for Kai. He moved with a decisiveness that other bandits didn't have. Though, he could see that other than strength, he didn't have much going for him.

Grekk might have been in the military, but it had been years since then and he looked haggard and bloodthirsty as he lunged for Kai.

A wind spell knocked him back as he fell on the ground and cursed.

As he tried to get up, Kai muttered the incarnation for [Cinder Circle].

Immediately, a vortex of flames rose from the ground, a few bandits and guards moving away from it as surrounded Grekk who yelled.

Taking the moment of his surprise, Kai jumped up in the vortex and punched him right in the face.

“W-What do you think you are doing?” Grekk said, trying to pick up his axe, but Kai kicked it away.

“Shut up! Or I will sever your head from your body.” Kai frowned, stomping his hands and locking him on the ground with wind spells.

He winced, but Kai kept kicking and punching him like he was a ragdoll.

If he wanted, he could easily kill him right then and there—but no.

The only reason Kai had personally come to battle the bandits was to make a mockery out of them and teach a lesson to every wandering bandit in his territory that might try something like this.

The only purpose to keep Grekk alive was to make him a lesson for others. For the next half an hour, painful cries echoed as the bandits lost.

39. Down the slope


A note from Extra26

The metallic tang of blood hung heavy in the air. Loud heaves and groans escaped from the wounded bandits who were scattered around the clearing.

Kai looked around the aftermath with a grimace. More bandits remained conscious than he had anticipated.

Over a half, by his count, lay groaning or slumped against trees, bound with their weapons abandoned in different places and their eyes widened with a mixture of terror and defeat, nervously looking at Kai, who had their boss under his feet.

The other half had been killed mercilessly, but his guards had gone softer than he had anticipated.

It did make sense since not every one of them had experience dealing with bandits. Most of the Enforcers they had brought were having their first battles either way.

“Help the wounded,” Kai rasped. His voice was rough with exertion. He was referring to the very few injured guards.

Two soldiers scurried past him to tend to the guards. The others, less seriously injured, gritted their teeth and pulled themselves upright, muttering curses and heading to grab bandages to stop bleeding.

Killian walked from behind. His armour was dented and scratched from the fight, his brow furrowed as he scanned through the area. “What’s the plan for these bandits?” he asked.

Kai met his gaze, a stern glint in his eyes. "Trials, Killian. Justice according to the law. But first…" He straightened, his gaze sweeping over the bandits. Many flinched under his gaze, some muttering amongst themselves.

"We make an example," he declared, his voice cutting through the clearing.

The air turned to a sudden tension as the bandits turned their heads towards him, a collective gasp escaping their lips. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

“Especially Grekk over here.” Kai kicked the boss of the bandits in his knee, earning a grunt from the man.

He was alive but Kai could see from how he curled into a ball he wished he was better dead.

A group huddled together took Kai's attention soon, shuffling forward hesitantly, led by guards.

Women, their eyes widened, lips quivering, were covering their mouths with shaky hands. Men had unmistakable marks of mine labour— ragged clothes, darkened skin and even noticeable signs of malnutrition alongside beatings.

Slaves. They were villagers stolen from nearby settlements and miners.

“Free them!” Kai’s voice came through.

Several soldiers moved forward in a hurry. They dropped their spears and started helping the slaves, looking for injuries and offering them waterskins from their packs.

The slaves shuffled towards the soldiers, some collapsing in tears of gratitude.

“Find a few soldiers who’re capable of helping them with their injuries,” he added, his voice softening.

He scanned the area once again.

Beyond the circle of wounded and captives, the bandit encampment sprawled beneath a watchful mountain range. The mine itself loomed like a hungry abyss in the mountainside, flanked by a squat warehouse and crumbling watchtowers.

Inhaling deeply, he noticed, the air here, heavy with the scent of iron and damp earth, felt different. A weird but usual sensation crawled up his spine, but there was an irregularity in the mana flow that his body recognized.

He stopped, head tilting back.

The sky was dark and heavy, common in the Frosania period. He inhaled again, feeling something that he wasn't able to pinpoint as he looked at the crags. He narrowed his eyes.

There is something strange in the mountains.

Kai cleared his throat, wanting to say what he felt, but he was disturbed by the hooves that shattered the silence.

His head snapped towards it, eyes narrowing as a lone rider came from the entrance.

Isn’t it that the traveller who we met before?

Kai had assumed he was a merchant of sorts, but there was no reason for him to be here. Especially when he already rejected his appeal to follow him.

The traveller grinned as Kai met his eyes.

Kai noticed something. There was something— no someone— two figures trailing behind him. Thick rope dragged them through the crusty ground, the horse carrying all the weight.

He looked at Killian who was gaping at the scene.

They both turned and looked at the traveller.

Who is this man?

Kai let his frown be clear to the traveller. The last time they met, he couldn’t even get his name— simply because it didn’t matter. But now, Kai was genuinely curious and partially annoyed.

The traveller got off his mount with a grunt, the ropes slackening as the unconscious figures slumped to the ground with a loud thud.

"Found these two skulking around the back of the mountains," the traveller said aloud. “They looked like bandits and after a punch or two, they accepted it, so I got them here. Figured you could use the extra prisoners." He grinned as if he was very proud of his achievement. “Accidentally killed one of their mates there by the way. He was a loudmouth and I didn't like it."

Kai stepped forward, looking at the traveller sceptically. There was just something he didn't understand when he looked at him.

His gaze narrowed as he locked eyes with the traveller. The nonchalant shrug, the casual mention of death, it all sat wrong. “What were you doing there? I thought I told you not to follow.”

The traveller met his stare unflinchingly. The grin was glued to his face annoyingly. “I’m sorry I was curious, so I had been watching. I didn't want to get in your way. Good battle you had there, Lord Arzan. Though I confess, I was surprised to see that the rumours of your lordship being a Mage are true."

“What is your name?” Kai asked, ignoring his last words.

“Does it matter? I thought there would be a reward for capturing these.” The man asked, ignoring Kai’s question.

Kai's hand twitched instinctively towards the spear as a flicker of rage passed through his eyes. The traveller's smile faltered, replaced by a grimace.

With a muttered curse, he bowed low. "My apologies, my lord. I didn’t mean to come off too strong. I’m Ansel, and I’m asking for forgiveness."

Kai nodded. This man wasn’t something he needed to deal with at the moment. He might be a wandering, curious warrior trailing the lands, not someone to give too much heed to. Though, for his help, he was going to help set him up on lodging and even some food.

Ansel certainly looked like he needed food, going by his skeletal frame.

Therefore, he gave him one last look and turned to Killian, he gestured towards the mine entrance. "We need to check the iron mines."

Killian raised an eyebrow. "The warehouse was clear," he rumbled. "Inventory records all accounted for. Seems no one was eager to buy bandit-mined iron."

"It's not the iron I'm worried about," Kai replied, a hint of urgency creeping into his voice. "There's something else down there. A feeling…" He trailed off, struggling to articulate the prickling sensation in the air.

Killian studied him for a moment but didn't voice out any thoughts.

With a curt nod, he barked out orders. Several guards stiffened. "Four of you," Killian yelled, his voice raspy. "Escort the new prisoners. The rest, with us."

Kai turned towards the mine entrance, his boots crunching on scattered branches and dust.

As he walked, a voice called him from behind.

“Lord Arzan?” The traveller from behind jogged forward. “Will it be alright if I just joined to look at the mines?”

With a sigh, Kai looked at him and didn't see a reason to refuse now that Ansel was already here.

"Fine," he conceded. "You can come. But keep your mouth shut unless spoken to.”

Ansel grinned before his expression vanished back to a neutral mask.

Before he could move forward, from behind, a figure shuffled forward. Kai halted in his steps.

He was among the few they had rescued from the bandits. His clothes were patched and worn and his face etched with exhaustion.

"My lord," he said, bowing low. "I… I overheard what you said. I’m Barold, I've been working here for quite some time as a miner. Thank you for saving my life. I had almost given up on it.”

Kai nodded, signalling him to get to the point.

“If you're heading into the mines, I can help. I know these tunnels better than anyone."

Kai studied the man for a moment. He needed someone who knew these tunnels, and this miner seemed the logical choice.

"Alright," he finally said. "Lead the way. And tell me about the bandits' operation here."

Barold straightened and started walking. "They captured us when we were returning from a day's duty months back. Killed the guards stationed here and took over it. Forced us to mine for days on end with barely enough food to survive. And… and they kidnapped people from nearby villages, forced them to work alongside us." His voice choked as he talked. "No pay, just threats and beatings. A few even committed suicide due to that."

Kai frowned. Even if he was used to hearing such stuff, a part of him couldn't help but blame Arzan for not being proactive enough.

“Don't worry, we will give you all compensation and help you recover.

Barold's eyes shone. His lips pursed as his hands came together. “Thank y-you.”

Kai nodded.

Barold turned and plunged into the darkness of the mine entrance.

Kai and others simply followed; the flickering torchlight painted shadows on the damp walls. The air grew thick and stale with the scent of iron. Kai felt a claustrophobic feeling as he walked.

It reminded him of the days he was trapped in the Sorcerer's Tower library with no way out and mana fiends roaming the upper levels. It had worked out in the end as he had gotten a new chance at life.

Focusing ahead, the mine was dark and the walls were narrow. It was a bit hard with the guards with such little space.

Still, they kept moving forward.

Minutes felt like hours as they went further and further. The scent of stale iron grew stronger, but Kai’s senses were focused on what he detected before.

Suddenly, he stopped, a hand raised in the air.

Barold, startled, stumbled to a stop a pace behind him.

"What is it, my lord?" the miner asked, his voice echoing eerily in the confined space.

Kai remained motionless for a moment, brow furrowed in concentration.

His hand twitched, a faint blue glow emanating from his fingertips. He tried to feel the mana in the surroundings.

"Something feels… strange," he murmured, his voice low. "There's a pressure here, a resistance I can't quite explain." He swept his gaze across the rough wall, the torches glinting off a faint seam in the rock.

Barold squinted at the spot Kai was indicating.

"There, my lord? That might be one of the old tunnel entrances. Sealed shut decades ago." He ran a calloused hand along the seam, a flicker of unease crossing his face. "Goes deep, but no one bothers with it. Leads down to the backside of the mountain range. It's been decades since anyone had entered."

There it is, then.

Kai kept staring at the wall, his senses flickering. He knew there was something inside of it and he had to see it for himself.

"Get everyone back," he ordered, his voice leaving no room for argument. "I need to do something."

Barold and the others exchanged nervous glances, but they obeyed without question.

As they retreated, Kai raised his hand, the blue glow intensifying.

He muttered a short incantation. “Exanimo Fervens!”

It was a 2nd circle spell better known as [Shatter Stone] and was simply used to shatter stone walls created by Mages specialising in earth magic most of the time. Here, it would be good enough to break the wall.

Soon, his spell structure came to life and with a deafening boom, a section of the sealed wall exploded outwards, showering the tunnel floor with dust and debris.

Ansel started coughing from behind as the dust hit his nostrils. Kai looked back and saw the miner close his ears and the guards covering their noses and mouths.

Killian gaped at the opening, a deep frown on his face. The rest of the guards had a similar expression etched on their faces.

"My lord," Barold stammered, his voice barely a whisper. "That… that slope goes very deep. We might not have enough rope to—"

Kai cut him off with a shake of his head.

The pull he felt, the strange mana fluctuations he'd sensed earlier, it all converged on this hidden passage.

"There's something down there," he said. "And I intend to find out what it is. We'll be careful," he promised, his voice firm. Turning to Killian, he requested, "Get me a rope! A long one."

Several guards scurried forward, securing a thick coil of hempen rope to an anchor point near the entrance.

After a bit of discussion, it was decided Killian and a few guards would go with them too.

With a nod, Kai tied one end around his waist, the reassurance of a lifeline settling in his stomach. Killian secured the other end around his own, a silent question hanging in his eyes.

After making sure the weight of a sturdy rock on the side was keeping it intact alongside the guards, they decided to head in.

“Don't worry too much," Kai murmured, meeting Killian's gaze. "I can feel something. A pull, a dissonance in the mana flow. There is no time for a full explanation.” he started walking in.

The air grew thick and humid as they headed down, the flickering torchlight barely penetrating the oppressive darkness.

The passage sloped downwards at a steep angle, forcing them to walk with careful steps. The drip of water echoed through the tight space.

Suddenly, Killian's voice cut through the heavy silence. "What is this place?" He gestured ahead, his voice tinged with awe.

They had come into a vast cavern. The rough walls were no longer the defining feature for them or what grabbed their attention. Instead, the ceiling and walls were studded with countless shimmering blue stones. They pulsed with a familiar energy— mana, making him feel a tingling sensation in his spine.

They also acted as a source of dim light. Everyone stared at them and were all too stunned to speak.

Finally, Kai broke the silence. "Atheum," he whispered, his voice reverent. "Or more commonly known… mana stones."

A low rumble echoed through the cavern, sending a shiver down Kai’s body, but he ignored it.

“Aren’t they incredibly rare?” Killian asked. “They are known as the hardest materials to get and Mages and Nobles pay their yearly savings on it easily. I never thought I would see them here.”

Kai was about to nod, but a chilling realisation dawned on him suddenly, a thought cold enough to make him look back at the glow of these mana stones.

Fuck…

These weren’t just a source of power— they were a beacon.

They were the source of concentrated mana, and as the ancient texts spoke of it, they were quite irresistible to magical creatures— more specifically, monsters. With this cave overflowing with mana stones… It would be a siren song for any monster.

The rumble he heard before intensified. The ground trembled beneath their feet. Kai whipped his head upwards, cursing himself in his head.

High above, he saw something— something clinging to the ceiling similar to a spider, the size of a wild boar— even larger? In the blue light, segmented exoskeleton showed, mandibles the size of logs crawled down slowly, patiently for the right moment.

A monstrous larva.

“A monster," Kai growled, the word heavy with dread. "This place… it's a feeding ground!” he whispered… His gaze swept across the area, a desperate plan forming in his mind. "We need to get out of here. Now!"

A low roar came from the monster who spotted the group of individuals. A red glow radiated from its multifaceted eyes. The sight was scary, but at that moment, they couldn’t afford to run anywhere else.

Kai started slowly moving, one step behind the other.

He wanted to get out of there as soon as possible, but before he could turn around, a sickening skittering sound broke the silence. The monster launched from the ceiling, its segmented body twisting and turning as it slid towards them.

Kilian roared, pulling his sword up, willing to take on if any attack swung their way.

But Kai was faster.

His reflexes kicked in. With just a flicker of his wrist, he cast a [Fire bolt]. A blazing bolt of fire erupted from his fingertips. It streaked through the air and slammed into the larva’s underbelly with a loud boom. A sizzle filled the air as flesh burnt.

Kai felt the guards withdrawing themselves back as he decided to handle as much as he could.

The larva recoiled, a shriek echoing through the walls. Burning ichor dripped from its wounded section, but the injury seemed to only enrage it further.

Kai unleashed three more [Fire Bolts] in a row. Each hitting the exact position where the first hit. Although the monster wiggled left and right, he seemed to have the perfect aim due to its large body.

But soon, a primal scream ripped the air. The monster slammed itself into the wall next to them. The entire place shook, bringing down a few rocks from the ceiling and dust covered their vision momentarily.

Cough! Cough!

The guards waved their hands to push away the dust as they coughed while Kai threw two more [Fire bolts] at the monster, earning earth-shattering noises.

The guards turned around, trying to get out of there.

Due to his fire bolts, he was able to momentarily see far into the room. Deciding to check something, he cast a trinket spell to light up the cave.

A ball of light floated from his other hand to the centre of the cave and he froze.

Are those…

His heart rate increased.

He had the plan to distract the monster and run… But now— a sinking feeling filled his heart.

The place was teeming with larvae!

Dozens of the monstrous creatures clung to the walls, their multifaceted eyes fixed on them with a predatory glint. The black shiny things made Kai’s skin crawl.

"Everyone escape!" Kai screamed.

As he realised his fire bolts were burning parts of the monsters, he unleashed another fireball in a desperate attempt to buy them more time. It struck another larva, igniting its body.

A painful but throaty shriek came out. But instead of dying, it opened its dark mouth and spat a ball of viscous green ooze.

Kai barely stopped it with a fireball, the two substances meeting in mid-air.

The green goo exploded in a shower of caustic acid. It fell on the ground, melting the very surface.

He looked around after seeing the acidic burn momentarily buying them time from them launching themselves forward.

He wanted to quickly run from this forsaken place, but the area behind them was hard to climb even with the rope.

Fortunately, guards were scrambling over him. Sweat covered their faces, but their limbs were tight and quick as they pulled everyone one after another through the opening by the rope. Killian went right before him.

Kai felt a hand grasp his wrist.

“Come on, Lord Arzan!” Killian’s voice came hurriedly.

He gave a final glance at the writhing mass of larvae, and flung another fireball, getting a precious few seconds. Then, with a surge of adrenaline, he launched himself upwards, his gloved hands making contact with the rough stone.

Guards were already on top and Kai quickly climbed the rope, not giving the monsters any time to come closer. As he kept up at it, he fired more bolts at the larvae. While doing so, his shoulders struck a sharp stone jutting out and he cursed.

He kept at it and in just two minutes, he was almost there.

Killian scrambled to push himself through the opening and guards pulled him up.

The same happened with Kai as stronger arms lifted him, dragging him back into the tunnel.

He sighed as he landed before the opened maw and scrambled back.

“Run away from it!” Killian ordered.

Soon, all of them started running through the tunnel, away from the hole where they could hear the thud of claws scraping against the stone.

Even Ansel, Barold and the rest of the guards who hadn't gone into the sealed part ran, having seen glimpses of the monsters living there.

The larvae’s tremors shook the cave but calmed down as they ran until their lungs started to burn.

Who thought it was a death trap I sensed?!

Kai couldn’t help but think as they reached the original tunnel entrance and jogged through the opening.

As soon as they were out, they hunched over and started breathing heavily.

Kai looked at everyone to see if there were any injuries, but no, they were all fine.

“Seal this opening later, they wouldn’t come past where Atheum is for now as it's too much of a climb and they would want to protect their energy source. But, we don’t know what’s in the cards for the future,” Kai muttered through heavy breaths, his eyes focusing on the few guards who stood before him.

They nodded, understanding the depth of the situation.

The other guards were still horrified by what they saw in the depths of the cave.

Killian stood beside him, his normally stoic face was turned to a frown, sweat covering his eyebrows. Even Ansel, who looked quite confident before, couldn't hide the tremor in his hand as he gripped his clothes.

"That… that wasn’t a dungeon, was it?" Ansel asked, staring at the mine opening. “I’ve never seen something like this before!” he yelled in the last part.

Kai shook his head, the movement itself sent a spike of pain through his shoulder. “No,” he croaked, his voice hoarse. “Those were vermal larvae or just vermala. Monstrous creatures that thrive on raw mana.”

These weren't simple monsters, but living conduits for destruction, drawn to the stones like moths to a flame. From what he knew, they were extremely dangerous, especially in a pack like this.

Kai pressed on, his voice gaining strength with each word.

"Vermala gather around large deposits of mana, forming a kind of… hive." He gestured towards the entrance. "And at the heart of every hive, a queen is ruling over them."

“We didn't see anything like that there. Most of them were identical to each other,” Killian said.

“It's probably much bigger than we expected and the queen is in her room.” Kai shrugged his shoulders, hoping to explain more about them.

He rubbed his hands together, feeling the sudden noticeable chill in the environment. Maybe it was because of the implications the larvae might have on his territory. "Well, as I was saying, the queen is a monstrous creature that lays eggs, replenishing the swarm. Leave them unchecked, and that larva will break through those walls, consume the entire mine, and spread outwards. The bandits…" He trailed off. "They were doomed either way."

The guards exchanged nervous glances. "How do we… deal with that?" One of them asked, speaking for them all.

The other lot nodded their heads.

Kai took a few seconds to himself. He thought back to what he knew about them as his eyes hardened. Recalling their strength and the size of the whole hive, there was only one option they had.

"We clear the nest," he said, his voice leaving no room for argument. "But not today." He swept his gaze over the assembled soldiers. They were all tired, but trying to stay tall and strong. "We're depleted, low on supplies. This requires planning."

A murmur of assent rippled through the ranks. All of them knew that charging headfirst into a monster den was asking for a disaster.

"We'll reinforce the entrance, make sure it holds for now."

Kai grimaced.

"For now," he echoed, the weight of the unseen threat pressing down on him.

Those Vermala wouldn't stay dormant forever. With each passing day, they'd grow stronger, and hungrier. He needed a solution, and fast.

"I'll need to work on some things," he muttered, more to himself than anyone else.

Alchemical concoctions, tactical formations, anything to give them an edge against that monstrous brood. This wasn't just about securing the mine anymore. This was about safeguarding the entire region from a tide of ravenous destruction.

They started walking towards the area where the rest of their forces were waiting alongside the captured bandits and slaves.

“Ready to move, Lord Arzan?” Killian asked and he nodded.

He had expected that with the bandits gone, things would be peaceful, but it seemed like his fate wasn't going to let him relax. At least with the Atheum present there, he might just be able to treat it as an opportunity.

Still before that, he had to eradicate the larvae. It was a long road to Veralt and a longer battle ahead.

***

The journey back was a grim procession.

The bandits, bound and gagged, were dragged along by their horses, their roughspun clothes torn and bloodied. The sound of scraping of their knees and hands on the dusty road was a grim counterpoint to the clopping of hooves.

Word of their return had spread like wildfire.

As they neared Veralt, villagers lined the road, their faces a mixture of curiosity and trepidation.

But when they saw the fallen bandits, a collective cheer erupted.

The whole way was like a hero group coming back from defeating the demon king. The bandits have terrorised the lands for too long and seeing them dragged gave everyone a reason to be happy after a long time.

Kai reigned on his horse before the bustling town square, the cheers washing over him like a wave. Their cheerful eyes said it all, but he knew he needed to make a statement.

He dismounted, his gaze sweeping over the multitude of jubilant faces.

They were all gathered there now, waiting for Kai to speak but their cheer took over the air.

Voices of different ages and maturity spoke unrecognisable things.

Raising his hand for silence, his voice hoarse but firm. "The bandits are gone," he said aloud. "They've terrorised this land for too long, taking your livelihood, your peace. But now, justice has been served."

A fresh wave of cheers rose, louder this time, punctuated by shouts of gratitude and praise. Kai raised a hand again, silencing the clamour.

"This," he continued, his voice cutting through the exhilaration, "is a reminder. A reminder that unlawfulness will not be tolerated. Anyone who will try to go against the rules and harm the common citizens will be dealt with."

His words hung in the air like a warning.

“As for the punishment, I would gladly allow the law to do its work. But, I believe they deserve something special!” Kai said, his eyes glinting something mischievous.

The crowd waited, whispering what it might be.

He had thought about different punishments to give to the bandits. Not only were they a nuisance, but Arzan's not being able to deal with them added to his low reputation in Veralt. He needed to change it now and this was the best way.

“I will allow ten slaps by all of you on each of them daily, as they’d be tied up on the square, right where we are now for the next week!”

A primal roar of approval erupted from the crowd, a sound far darker than the joyous cheers that had greeted their return. Villagers, their eyes gleaming with a cold, unforgiving light, surged forward like a wave.

"Let me at 'em!" a burly man said aloud, his face contorted with rage. "They stole away the swords I made when I was delivering them."

A wiry woman, her clothes patched and worn, shook her fist at the bound bandits. “I will never forgive you for slaving my son!"

Miners, their faces etched with the hardship inflicted by the bandits, shared a look– a silent, predatory grin. Soon, bets were placed amongst them, not on coin flips or the roll of dice, but on who could deliver the most punishing slap.

Kai watched the men walking forward, women cheering from the sides.

It was almost chaotic and he had to tell the guards to make sure they didn't end up killing the bandits. Still, it was amusing.

He felt no remorse for them. In his mind, they were lucky he hadn't tried to give them a punishment himself.

***

Is this really… Happening?

Ansel pinched himself in his hand to make sure he wasn’t living in a dream.

Standing at the back of the crowd, he watched the guards make a line and bind the bandits on the town's square. The people took turns punching and kicking them.

Every time someone would land a hard slap, a cheer would erupt.

The hardest cheers went up when Grekk was being trashed. A few people even threw rocks at him and laughed.

It was truly a scene he had never seen anywhere else.

His eyes soon moved to watch Lord Arzan moving towards his horse to leave for his estate.

Ansel had been wrong in his initial doubts about him. He had watched the battle in the settlements and seen every bit of how he had overwhelmed the bandits like they were kids.

Even in the mines, he had shown a lot of courage.

I believe I’m at the right place, finally.

Ansel’s eyes loomed over Lord Arzan until he turned around a corner. Originally, he had come there to depart after a week, but there might be a change in plans now.

41. The queen's dilemma


A note from Extra26



Go check out a friend of mines book. It's out on KU. And is kingdom building.

https://www.royalroad.com/amazon/B0CWT3T1YG





The morning coldness bit at Kai’s skin, but it couldn’t cool away the fire that simmered in his gut.

After he came back from the square, he was notified that the bandits were tied up and the slaves were helped. They were also in the process of getting them back to their families. But it wasn’t what gave him a weird knot in his stomach, it was about what lay in the future. It was about what he saw inside the mine.

He sighed.

I should do something about it instead of worrying.

He raised a hand, casting the spell to activate [Hawk eyes], and pushing mana through his veins. The familiar sensation of the enhanced vision washed over him, transforming the bustling city square below into a detailed tableau.

He looked at the central figure— the makeshift pillory erected for the captured bandits. People walked by, occasionally glancing at the bandits and a small crowd circled them.

Even from this far away, he could see the raw hatred that was on their faces— noses scrunched, shouting curses at the bandits.

A half-eaten cabbage arced through the air, splattering harmlessly against a bandit’s arm. It was the only food that flew and next, a well-aimed rock found its mark, eliciting a yelp of pain.

A single guard stood near the pillar, his face twisted in a smirk rather than concern. He looked like a bored spectator rather than a protector, content to make sure the ‘entertainment’ didn’t turn fatal.

He was there to make sure the bandits didn't have any serious injuries. Although he was giving them punishment, he had to still apply the kingdom's law and send them to the cells.

It was a strange thing. Despite it being thousands of years in the past, the kingdom had strict laws and regulations that were meant to be followed by all nobles and commoners alike. No wonder it had been able to become an empire in the future.

The foundations were always there.

His hawk eye flickered, zooming in on a rough calendar that was drawn into the wooden post of the pillory.

Seven deep gouges marked the days, a countdown to the bandits’ release— or rather, their transfer to the cold, impersonal confines of the jail.

He lowered his hands, the light blue light disappearing. It looked like the people were all enjoying the punishment given to the bandits. And again, who could blame them?

His brow remained furrowed. His thoughts started shifting between the day that the bandits would be imprisoned and–

"Admiring the birds, Lord Arzan?" a gentle voice inquired from beside him. Claire stood nearby, a tray of untouched breakfast balanced on a silver platter.

His thoughts were interrupted, but he quickly remembered that he was the one requested for breakfast on the terrace.

Kai offered a wry smile. "Not exactly, Claire. Just keeping an eye on things."

"Ah," she replied, her voice laced with a hint of curiosity. "The bandits, then? With the distance, they must appear quite small from here."

He chuckled, appreciating her subtle way of inquiring without overstepping. "Something like that. It's a spell that allows me to see clearly from afar."

Claire's eyes widened and twinkled in a way they would whenever he would show her a new spell. It seemed like she treated them like how children treated magic tricks.

“That sounds like a great spell to keep a watch over the city," she said, her eyes shifting to a more earnest level. "You've done well for us. There was quite a celebration on my street last night. Many miners were there, men who lost their jobs because of those brigands."

Kai nodded, a frown crossing his features. "I appreciate that, Claire. But the truth is, this isn't entirely over yet."

He gestured towards the square, his gaze hardening slightly. "The mines… they still remained closed. The monsters we encountered down there pose a serious threat. Until we deal with them, miners cannot return to work. So, you see. I haven’t quite solved it all yet."

Claire's smile faltered for a moment, but she straightened her back. “Then you'll deal with them, Lord Arzan," she declared, her voice firm. "You always do."

Claire's faith in him made him smile.

It was good to know that he had everyone’s support inside the castle. It was better than whatever Arzan had and if things continued like this, he might just be able to do his own things without worrying.

"But how can you be so confident?" he asked, a genuine curiosity lacing his voice. "This isn't just a band of bandits. These monsters down in the mine… they're dangerous."

She set the tray down on a nearby table, and the clatter of fine silver was heard. She turned to face him, her gaze steady and unwavering. "Because, Lord Arzan," she explained, "You haven't disappointed us since you started to work on the castle. You've found ways to protect Veralt, to solve whatever problem that was there. So, I believe you would deal with things again. I go out in the streets and a lot of people think similar.”

He smiled. It was a genuine reassurance, but something tugged on his mind. "That's a heavy burden to bear, Claire.”

"Perhaps…" She lowered her eyes for a moment, thinking about it. "But then again, you always seem to manage just fine. So, Lord Arzan…" she said, unsure of her own thoughts.

Kai nodded. The responsibility came with stakes, even for him, personally. But he was willing to accept it. “I’ll see what I can do." He glanced at the pristine breakfast. “I would need some fuel before I think about tackling those monsters."

Claire slightly bowed, knowing the conversation was over and excused herself after putting the food on the table.

A cold wind flew and hit him in his neck as he sighed.

Kai’s mind flooded again with all the problems. Some were unavoidable, and some needed instant solutions. Either way, breakfast comes first.

He bit into the piece of bread, the cold air nipping at his cheeks as he watched the birds cautiously stepping on a snow-laden branch in unison.

***

Francis’s administration office was packed with Killian, Kai and of course, Francis.

Spread across the polished table was a series of carefully drawn sketches and detailed notes. More specifically, Francis’s report on the Vermala larvae they had encountered in the mine.

Kai had told him to prepare one and fortunately, it seemed like these monsters would sometimes appear around areas with high mana density and were a pain for a lot of Mages, so there was sufficient research on them.

Killian’s lips pursed and his hand on his chin traced a finger on one of the sketches. “Over fifty of them,” he rumbled, his voice heavy with concern. “That’s a sizable nest. It seemed like there could even be more, but I don't think there's that much space.”

Kai nodded grimly. His eyes too, were on the sketches and the reports that were in front of them. “And that’s not including the queen,” he added, tapping another sketch of a monstrous creature. “It’s the heart of the hive, the source of their power. The queen possesses an organ that acts like a mana reservoir. It not only fuels its own power but also projects an aura that boosts the strength and morale of the surrounding larvae. Until it's dealt with, we won't be able to win.”

Francis threw the cigar that was in his mouth to the side of his desk and leaned forward.

Killian slowly nodded, his eyes drawing in between Kai and Francis. "So we take out the queen, the rest of them crumble?"

Kai cleared his throat. "Not entirely crumble, Killian. They will still be formidable opponents, but considerably weaker without the queen's influence. However, taking it down will be no easy feat."

He paused for a moment and studied the sketch of the queen he had drawn himself from what he recalled from his memories. "In fact, it wouldn’t be easy at all," he said. "But it's the only way. We can't afford a prolonged battle with a swarm of those things at our backs."

Killian nodded. “Also, what are we going to do about her eggs?”

Kai frowned. It was the only reason they were hurrying with the clearing of the nest.

It was common knowledge that the queen of the Vermala hatched its eggs at the end of the months of Frosania. If they didn't hurry, they might just have to deal with double the number of larvae.

Larvae grew fast, so it would only take two to three weeks for the new ones to reach adulthood. If that happened, there was no guarantee they would even be able to exterminate them.

“Once we deal with the queen, we will burn them. That's the only way to make sure the mine is safe.” Kai looked at both of them. "We'll need everything. Potions, traps, whatever advantage we can muster. And we'll need to move quickly before those larvae get any stronger. The longer we delay, the worse."

Killian nodded curtly. "The guards are ready, Lord Arzan. They're well-trained, but…" he hesitated, his brow furrowed. "We can't take many. Maybe ten more than the ones that were with you against the necromancer. Training takes time, and we don't have much of that. Enforcers should be of great help."

Francis cleared his throat, grabbing their attention. "Even with ten more, Lord Arzan," he interjected. "Most of the city guards haven't seen real battle, let alone fought underground. The necromancer fight is good learning, but this is entirely different. This is no walk in the park. We need a plan that minimises casualties, not throws untrained men into a monster pit."

Kai winced, the memory of the fallen soldiers against the necromancer flashing through his mind. He had regretted a few things from the fight with the necromancer, and losing guards was a big part of it. "You're right, Francis," he admitted. He sighed while his hands stroked the growing stubble. "We can't afford another bloodbath. If we don't plan this with proper measurements, the cost will be too high.”

A tense silence settled over the room, the weight of the situation pressing down on them. They needed a solution, and fast. Training more guards was an option, but the urgency of the situation wouldn't allow for a lengthy training session.

They all thought what better could they do? Even Kai fell into deep thought and the only thing that moved was the wind outside the windows.

A few ideas came to his mind, but he rejected them all, one after another. Too risky, too vague, can’t and won’t work in such a short time, guards too untrained to do it— reasons piled up higher than the solutions.

"Mercenaries?" Francis finally spoke, his voice a hesitant question.

Both Kai and Killian looked at him.

Kai was about to speak but Killian snorted. "Finding good ones is a gamble, and even then, loyalty tends to be a luxury they charge extra for."

Francis steepled his fingers, his brow furrowed in thought. "True, but desperate times call for desperate measures. For the right coin, they'll take the job. They might not be loyal, but they'll be skilled."

Kai mulled it over. The risks were undeniable, but they were running out of options. In his previous life, mercenaries were known by a lot of names and there were designated ones like fiend hunters.

They also followed a more structured system with an organisation handling them called the guild. From his research, he knew that wasn't the case here.

So, finding good ones might be a problem.

As he thought more, an idea popped up.

"Francis," he said, a decision forming in his mind. "Reach out to Malden. He should know the mercenary market better than us. See if he can find us a group with a verifiable track record."

Francis' face lit up with a flicker of hope.

"For sure, Lord Arzan. I'll send word first thing in the morning."

"In the meantime," Kai continued, turning his gaze towards the window, it was getting darker— darker than it usually was due to Frosania. "I can be of some use. Potions, of course— healing draughts to keep our men fighting fit. I can brew them and I might have other ideas in mind as well." he rubbed his hands together, deep in thought. "For that, though, I'll need some space. A workshop of sorts."

Francis didn't hesitate. "Consider it done, Lord Arzan. I'll clear out a suitable room immediately. Whatever you need, you'll have it."

Kai nodded. In a way, it was much easier to obtain materials in this period of time.

In his time, resources were extremely rare, especially for alchemy and due to that, alchemists were dime a dozen. Few countries had even gone to war just because of resources to use in alchemy and other magical arts.

Compared to that, everything was in abundance here. It was truly the era before the golden era and he knew he could take full benefit of it.

He started to walk back after completing the meeting.

A monster nest to purge— It was the next on his list.

My Demonic Farm: CHAPTER 1





* * *





Frosania was coming to an end. Amyra could feel it as she looked outside the window. From the position where she was, she could see the frost that hung tenaciously to the landscape for months was finally loosening its grip, revealing patches of green.

The syncing thwack of training swords echoed from the distant courtyard.

She inhaled to sigh, but the aroma of warm bread and honeyed fruits filled her nostrils.

Amyra picked up a piece of bread. It was toasted— the crispy crust made a noise to her touch. She started chewing on it slowly, noticing no more pain when she did. The ache in her jaw was completely healed.

She quickly grabbed the cup of water and drank some of it.

A glance at her arms caught her eye. No longer were they marred by the angry red gashes and bruises.

She sighed. Arzan had properly healed her, visiting every other day, pouring his magic onto her skin, making it smooth and unmarked.

A warm and heavy feeling settled in her chest. Gratitude. She was grateful that Arzan found her when he did. If not for him, there wouldn’t be a day that she would taste bread this fresh.

But, beneath the surface, a slight fear remained. It was the memories of the necromancer's chilling touch.

She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to push the images away.

Despite her efforts, more images popped up of time before the necromancer found her. Those were even more grotesque and for a while, she heard painful screams in her ears.

The days of confinement, watching numerous deaths and finally running away only to get caught by another evil man.

“Stop!”

She shook her head, frowning and managing to end it.

When she opened her eyes, the urge to look around took over. She didn't want to sit around only for those memories to haunt her again.

Amyra hasn’t been in the place for too long. Four walls, a plush bed, and a monotonous routine were her now reality.

Her hands itched for the door, to open it and walk around, but she paused.

Should I—maybe not? But what’s the harm if no one catches me, right?

Finally mustering up the courage, she opened it, reaching the corridor immediately. As she stepped outside, there was a staircase adjacent. Her one aim was not to get caught by a maid, guard or— worse, Arzan.

He might not even be here. He has his routine, I believe.

She took one step at a time, her bare feet cold against the floor. She walked gently, trying to not make any noise.

Taking the stairs to the ground floor, she decided to venture there first. As she reached it, she saw a door on the far side and stepped towards it.

The door opened to the outside.

The chilly air hit her in the face. She could see the estate, buildings, the courtyard and even the water fountain. It truly has been too long since she had been outside.

Unfamiliar faces were everywhere. Guards, staff and maids.

She waited until most of them passed and then made her way through the courtyard. Finding herself in a building adjacent to the one she was staying in, she stepped towards it, finding the whole thing exciting in her heart.

Fortunately, she found an open window and managed to climb through it.

Another corridor was upon her and she didn't waste any time standing idle.

Tiptoeing her way quickly through different doors, she walked through large, polished oak doors. Adrenaline rushed to her body and she could hear her heart thrumming inside her chest.

She hid behind an oak door, peeking at what was beyond through the little space that was beneath the door and the wall.

It seemed like the kitchen.

Maids walked from left and right hurriedly. All of them were busy with their own duties.

Amyra remembered how Arzan once mentioned that even the maids knew who she was, and she could ask for anything from them.

But I can’t be seen…

She watched through the space for a few minutes. Spoons clattering, vegetables chopping, voices of maids talking to each other about the gossip in the city and the estate.

Amyra watched until one of the maids headed towards the door.

She instantly took it as an invitation to head towards the stairs that stood on the right side.

Her curiosity tugged at every corner of her being. Her feet were quick but silent. She passed walls of weaponaries and different frames on her way upstairs.

As she reached the top floor, she paused for a moment to catch her breath.

No one seemed to be around, but there was some sort of a noise echoing across the floor like someone was turning pages in a hurry.

Her eyes squinted in curiosity. The sound came behind the wooden doors… What is it?

She mulled over the fact that it could be a library.

Amyra’s shaky hands softly touched the door, trying to open it without making any squeaky noises.

It was a success. She was inside.

The wooden shelves garnered her attention. Tons of books were placed in them. She had been allowed to read and although they quelled her boredom, she had already finished with whatever was given to her.

So, this was a surprise.

She slowly walked through the shelves, wondering if she should take a book out, but just then, she froze.

In the heart of the room, she immediately recognized Lord Arzan, his back to her.

He was hunched over what looked like a workbench.

She slowly hid behind the pillar that seemed to hold and balance the roof, hoping to not get caught as she watched him.

From where she stood now, she could see his hands. The same hands that healed her were now on grey clay, moulding in the shape of a ball, no— what is that?

He wiped his hands from the dirty cloth that was to his left and turned a few pages on the book to his front.

Then, he frowned before squeezing the clay in frustration, making Amyra gasp slightly.

The next second, his head snapped in a mere heartbeat before she could even hide herself properly.

Both of them froze.

***

As was his custom most mornings, Kai found himself hunched over a workbench in the library, his hands were busy moulding a lump of grey clay.

He’d been so engrossed in the art of animating clay fingers that he hadn’t heard a single noise of the door opening.

But as he heard the gasp right behind her, he turned around, his eyes meeting Amyra and he froze.

The ball of clay dropped to the floor as he stared into her golden eyes.

A startled yelp escaped her lips. She clutched the pillar for a moment, as if unsure of what to do before her eyes looked at the door like she wanted to run away.

"Amyra," Kai said, forcing a smile. "It's good to see you out of your room. Must be stifling to be cooped up for so long."

She offered a hesitant nod, her gaze flickering around the room before settling back on him.

"If you want?" he asked, gesturing towards a nearby chair.

Kai gestured for her to sit, a wave of relief washing over him as she did.

He returned to his work on the clay, his brow furrowed in concentration. But something about the way her gaze kept trailing back to the lump of formless material piqued his curiosity.

"I’m trying to build up a golem from the clay. So far, it’s not been great for me, but y’know. Learning is a process,” he said, glancing up at her.

She nodded once again. Her eyes were glued to the clay, curiosity evident in them.

"Golem?" she muttered, the word barely a whisper.

Kai smiled, setting the clay figure down for a moment. "Golems," he echoed, "are essentially animated figures, created from clay or other materials. Think of them as… well, imagine a powerful hero, a knight, a mage— anything, really— brought to life by magic, given a physical form from this very material." He tapped the clay for emphasis. "I'm trying to hone my skills in creating them."

Amyra's brow furrowed in confusion. The concept seemed alien to her, yet a spark of interest flickered in her eyes. "Creating… heroes?" she repeated.

“Yes.” He nodded.

Seeing her interest, Kai set aside his partially formed golem and reached for another lump of clay.

"Would you like to try?" he offered, a playful glint in his eyes.

He was a bit surprised by how she walked inside without any guidance, but anything was better than distancing herself. More than that, Kai just enjoyed the company. It’s always entertaining to learn with company rather than alone.

Especially after his last few years in the Sorcerer's Tower.

By his question, Amyra looked surprised. She blinked. Her lips pursed, hesitation flickering slightly. But after a moment, she nodded, mirroring Kai’s smile.

Kai kept the soft clay on the table and walked around, placing it in front of her.

Soon, he went back to his previous task as she started on it. He did the same, hoping he would be able to make a good one this time.

Silence filled over. The only sound was of the squelch of their fingers moulding the material.

This time, Kai was trying to learn from his past mistakes as his muscle memory kicked in. He began shaping his clay into a miniature warrior, working on one side of it before moving to the next.

Amyra, on the other hand, looked like she was having a hard time. Her clay figure, once just a blob, had morphed into something vaguely… spiky. A tail, vaguely reptilian, sprouted from one end.

Lumpy appendages, more looking like claws were on the sides. The whole thing was topped with a triangular head.

Kai glanced at it for a second before focusing on his one, his fingernails helping to sculpt the fingers of the warrior.

A peaceful hour passed by as they battled with the clay.

Finally after so long, he looked at the golem that stood proudly, a miniature guardian barely two feet tall. It looked a bit rough at the edges and the sword he had made looked nothing like one.

He had also messed up his face and armour, but compared to his first few tries, the improvement was clearly visible.

He smiled before looking at Amyra's piece.

Unlike his work, her golem wasn't easy to categorise and he kept looking at it for a while in confusion.

It seemed like a monster of sorts with the way it was structured and the claws. Certainly not a human or a beastman. Just, it was rough and hard to make out.

He tilted his head, squinting at whatever it was before him until he finally got it.

"Not bad," he said, trying his best to keep a straight face.

Amyra's brow furrowed. "Not bad?" she echoed a hint of hope in her voice.

"Not bad at all," Kai confirmed. "For a first try at a dragon, that is."

Amyra's face immediately drained of colour. Her lips parted. Panic flooded her features as she sputtered, "But… but it was supposed to be a bunny!"

Kai froze, smiling wryly.

“Oh,” his mouth opened to say something, something to make it better, but nothing came out.

Amyra kept looking at her creation before lowering her head and pouting at Kai.

***

“Nightshade petals, elder wood root, water of purity,” Francis muttered, tracing his finger down the list. “These are readily available, Lord Arzan. Shops here are well-stocked with these things as a lot of them are used for cooking and other stuff too."

The list was kept on the table as Kai observed Francis slowly going through the items he mentioned.

He continued down the list, nodding in recognition at items like bat guano, brimstone powder, and vials of mercury. However, as his gaze reached the bottom, a frown creased his forehead.

"Glowstone dust? Blackwood beast scales? And what in the world is 'Void Pinch'? These… I haven't encountered them before.”

Kai winced internally as he realised what he had done. He'd gotten so caught up in translating the knowledge from his past life that he hadn't considered the names might not translate directly.

Items might be known as something completely different or the monsters or plants they came from weren't that common. After all, in thousands of years, the ecology has changed a lot.

He had made this mistake because, in the books he read, he recognised a lot of ingredients. A few had different names, but they had the same function.

Moreover, a lot of them were extremely rare and potent in his world. So, he had been excited to get his hands on them.

"Don't worry about the specifics, Francis," he said, a touch of sheepishness creeping into his voice. "Just acquire what you can from the marketplace. Focus on the general descriptions— glowing dust from a luminous stone, tough scales from a large, winged creature, a rare herb with dark, almost inky flowers."

Francis nodded slowly, a hint of confusion flickering in his eyes. "Very well, Lord Arzan. I'll do my best to find... whatever a 'Void Pinch' might be."

Kai chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Let's just say it's not a common ingredient in here." He cleared his throat, changing the subject. "While you're at the market, see if you can arrange a short patrol mission for the guards. Outside the city walls, of course. Tell them to focus on…" He paused, considering his options.

"Trolls," he finally decided. "And Emblem Elks, if they can find any. Their… byproducts will be helpful for certain potions."

Francis raised an eyebrow. "Emblem Elks, Lord Arzan? Those are quite rare and very aggressive. Are you sure?"

"Desperate times," Kai said his thoughts aloud. "Besides, the guards need some practice, and those creatures shouldn't be too difficult for a well-coordinated squad."

"As you wish," Francis said, making a note on a separate parchment. "One more thing, Lord Arzan. I believe the leatherworker, Rosalind, is waiting outside. Would you like me to call her in?"

“Yes, sure,” he said as Francis walked to tell a guard outside the door to call Rosalind.

Every noble had their own people to make clothes and armour. The City of Veralt was the same. Specific people mastered the making of specific things and exclusively worked for nobles.

Though today, he wasn't looking to build leather armour.

Francis frowned as he returned. “I wonder, Lord Arzan…” he paused, glancing at his expressions. “Why do you need Rosalind?”

“Alchemy… it can be a messy business. Fumes, explosions, strange concoctions bubbling away— we can say that a lot of alchemists meet unfortunate ends thanks to their cauldrons bursting. That too, a lot of those deaths don't even get out because it's known as shameful.”

Francis’s eyes widened. “Then surely, Lord Arzan, a protective suit is a necessity. We can't put your life into any kind of danger,” he said before putting a hand on his chin. “I believe something with reinforced stitching and a good hood to shield your face from those vapours would be a good fit.”

Kai nodded. A slow smile spread across his face. “Precisely, that was my plan.” he pointed at the parchments that were in front of them.

“I’ve only seen top alchemists make one of those protective suits. Apprentices and novices usually work… well, without them." Francis said hesitantly, "The dangers of alchemy simply haven't crossed my mind, Lord Arzan."

Kai sighed, a wry smile playing on his lips. This world, it seemed, hadn't quite grasped the full spectrum of risks associated with alchemical experimentation.

If he was right, most alchemist won't even live too long spending their lives around the fumes. It was only by the end of the Golden era of magic that it had become a norm in alchemy with new apprentices giving suits of their own.

Even then, from what he knew, it was because a genius alchemist had died in an explosion at a young age, prompting the ruling of such a law.

"Think of it like a warrior going into battle without armour," he explained. "Sure, some might survive on luck and skill, but why tempt fate? A little protection goes a long way."

A knock on the door interrupted their conversation.

Kai gestured for the person to enter and as it opened, it revealed a middle-aged woman with a confident stride walking in.

Kai immediately noticed the callouses on her hands.

"Rosalind Tannery, at your service, Lord Arzan," she announced, bowing her head respectfully.

Kai nodded in return, appreciating the no-nonsense air about her.

"Rosalind," he began, gesturing to the parchments. “I have a request that's a bit… unconventional. I need a protective suit made from tough leather, preferably reinforced at the seams. Think of something that could withstand minor explosions and shield the wearer from noxious fumes."

Rosalind's eyes widened as she looked at the parchment.

The request was certainly out of the ordinary, but her curiosity seemed to be piqued. She unfolded the parchment and studied the rough sketch he had drawn. It was a hooded suit with gloves and boots.

"Interesting," she murmured, tracing the lines with a calloused finger. “I haven't made anything quite like this before. But a challenge is always welcome. Tell me, Lord Arzan, what kind of movement do you expect in this suit? Will you be standing over a cauldron most of the time, or will there be a lot of bending and reaching?”

Kai tapped his chin thoughtfully. "A good mix of both, I suppose. I'll need to be able to move freely, but also be protected if something goes… awry."

Rosalind nodded. "Leave it to me, Lord Arzan," she said. "I'll craft a suit that's both durable and allows for flexibility. Give me a few days, and I'll have something you'll be pleased with."

Kai returned a smile at those words.

Having the space of a large estate had its own perks. One of them, Kai realized was the number of rooms at his disposal.

Most of the guest rooms were empty, and storage rooms overflowed with forgotten trinkets, gifts received by the previous lord and just general items that had long been replaced— leaving more unused space.

He had decided to use one of those storerooms as his alchemical workshop.

As he opened the wooden door with a creak, the scent of dust and disuse gave way to a more pleasant medley of woodsmoke and simmering herbs. The storeroom that had been cluttered was now his personal alchemy workshop.

He had seen what was in the room before, and now seeing it after Francis had ordered the maids to clean it up while he oversaw it, it looked like another room itself.

Sturdy wooden tables, their surfaces gleaming with a thin coat of oil replaced the dusty crates of the storeroom. Glass jars of various sizes, filled with different colours — blues, greens, and fiery oranges — lined the shelves against the wall.

In the centre of the room, a large iron cauldron rested on a strong brick stand, its blackened belly showed that it wasn’t a new one but instead a used one which wasn't a big deal for him.

Kai ran a satisfied hand over the smooth surface of a mortar and pestle. He would have to start his craft with what Francis could obtain from the market, and the selection of ingredients was far from ideal.

There was no glowstone dust, no blackwood beast scales, and the closest he’d gotten to Void Pinch was a pouch of something labelled “Shadowbloom” that looked suspiciously like common nightshade. But he has to manage what he receives.

Creating portions from these could at least help their chances.

In his former life, he wasn’t exactly a novice when it came to alchemy. A third-grade Alchemist— far from a master, but close enough to be considered an expert.

He had spent hours learning it because his master had pushed the fact that a good Mage needs to have mastery of the magical arts.

Therefore his mind was filled with knowledge of magical items, the properties of rare herbs, and the delicate art of potion-making.

It wasn’t the same here, of course. The ingredients were different, and the techniques he could use were slightly unfamiliar, but Kai believed that the core principles had remained the same.

He might not be able to brew all the potions that he has practised making in his previous life, but with these basic ingredients, he could create potions that would give his men a fighting chance.

Healing draughts, stamina enhancers, even rudimentary firebombs— honestly, anything to tip the scales in their favour.

Moreover, in this era, he could find ingredients without worry, so if he actually tried to ask Malden to search for them, he might be able to get his hands on stuff that had long past gone extinct when he had started his training.

Thinking about it, he smiled and looked towards the cauldron.

Now, it was time. Time to finally get on with making the potions. Two nights had gone by in trying to find all these ingredients and he didn't want to waste more.

Let’s get it started with.

First of all, he moved towards the safety equipment. Years of experience had made it natural for Kai to give priority to safety, especially after the experience of seeing one of his fellow apprentices blowing his head off right in front of him.

The safety suit Rosalind created was amazing. A hood covered his face alongside a mask, and the measurements she had done were perfect. There were gloves and everything was covered.

In the case of an explosion, he was sure that he would easily survive.

Even if she was known to be a master in what she did, Kai silently expected that there would be adjustments that needed to be made. But it seemed like Rosalind understood what could be expected in alchemy.

Kai’s hands raked over his clothes one last time.

The final touch— he cast a simple protection spell, [Eye shield]. It was a simple spell that would protect his eyes from flashy lights and fumes, especially when he worked around the cauldron.

With that done, he walked towards the table in front of the shelves that had jars and vials. Looking at what was displayed, he noted where everything was and placed whatever he needed on the table.

He went back to the cauldron and lit it up.

Kai began.

He reached for the first ingredient— a bundle of Nightshade leaves and Nightshade dust, a pale imitation of the Void Pinch he craved. He crushed them into a fine powder, releasing a pungent aroma that filled the air.

With that, Kai pushed his mana out.

That was to enhance the effects of the ingredients. He poured the Nightshade powder into the bubbling cauldron, whispering an incantation under his breath. His mana, a subtle blue energy, went from his fingertips, weaving through the air.

The goal was simple, a health potion. Therefore, a majority of the products were herbs.

A few minutes passed by as his mana gelled with the herbs, and then he started mixing the ingredients slowly.

As he stirred, he focused on manipulating his mana to get the effect out of the herbs. They turned blue before slowly turning into shades of purple.

He started adding colourless water of purity and elder wood roots. It all blended in quickly as the bright purple began to sparkle.

He mixed it all with a ladle, being careful about the amounts of ingredients he had used. Soon, it started giving off a certain aroma which meant he was in the right direction.

The final step was to add the byproducts of Emblem Elks.

Kai held his breath, waiting for the potion to stabilize. He continued to manipulate the fire and the ingredients using his mana.

The ingredients were no longer there to be seen. The bubbly water started to sparkle. But its aggression made Kai hesitate with the ladle.

Will it explode?

He held his breath, waiting for something to happen. Although he had put in efforts to make sure he had all the ingredients right, he had used a few replacements he wasn't sure would fit.

It was very dangerous normally since you never know how a particular ingredient would react to another, but Kai had been fairly confident in his eye.

Now, it was time to find out if he had been right.

A few seconds passed by as he waited and stared at the potion.

Slowly, the bubbling subsided and a sigh of relief escaped his lips.

But soon, his relief shattered by a sudden hiss. Fumes, acrid and pungent blasted from the cauldron.

He reacted instantly.

Fuck…

He flung open the window, forcing the fumes to escape.

The air was getting thicker and stronger making him cough. He wiped the tear from his eye.

Soon, the smoke disappeared through the window and the air felt better.

His eyes immediately went to the potion. Thankfully, the cauldron looked like it was unaffected.

The bubbles calmed down. It was not blue anymore, or purple— but green.

Healing potions and green? Did anything change its colour?

At one glance, he could proudly say that it was what it was supposed to look like other than the colour. But has he created the portion properly?

With some hesitation, Kai dipped the ladle into the potion, a small amount clung to the wood. He brought it to his lips, wondering what spell to use if things go wrong.

He tasted it a little, but the sound of the door opening made him drop the ladle down.
