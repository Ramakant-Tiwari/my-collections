I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
CHAPTER 1: SCHOLAR MENG HAO
The State of Zhao was a very small nation [1]. Like other small
nations in the lands of South Heaven, its people admired the Great
Tang [2] in the Eastern Lands, and they admired Chang’an
[3]. Not only did the king carry this admiration, all scholars in the
State of Zhao did. They could see it, almost as if they stood atop the
Tower of Tang in the capital city, oh so far away.
This April was neither extremely cold, nor scorching hot. Light winds
caressed the land, passing the Qiang Di flutes of the Northern Desert,
blowing over the lands of the Great Tang.
Under the twilight sky, it lifted the fog-like dust, then swirling, twisting,
reached Mount Daqing in the State of Zhao. Then it fell onto a young

man who sat there on the mountaintop.
He was a lean young man, holding a bottle gourd and wearing a
clean blue scholar’s robe. He appeared to be about sixteen or
seventeen. He was not tall, and his skin was somewhat dark, but his
bright eyes sparkled with intelligence. And yet, all his intelligence
seemed to be hidden by the frown on his face. He seemed lost.
“Failed again...” He sighed. His name was Meng Hao, an average
student from Yunjie County, which lay at the foot of the mountain [4].
Years ago, his parents went missing, and did not leave much behind
in the way of assets. Education was expensive, so he was almost
completely broke.
“I’ve taken the Imperial exams three years in a row. In all that time, I
read books written by the sages until I wanted to throw up. Maybe
that isn’t the path for me after all.” Filled with self-deprecation, he
looked down at the gourd bottle, his eyes bleak.
“My dream of becoming an official and getting rich just keeps getting
farther and farther away.
I might as well forget about trying to reach the Great Tang... How
useless to be a student.” He laughed bitterly. Sitting there on the
silent mountaintop, gazing at the bottle gourd in his hand, he looked
increasingly lost. He began to feel fear. What would he do in the
future? Where would he go?
Perhaps a high-ranking official would take an interest in him, or a
beautiful young maiden. Or would he continue to take the exams,
year after year?
There were no answers to the questions. He was but a teenager, and
this feeling of being lost had devoured him like a giant invisible
mouth. He truly felt afraid.

“Even the teachers in town can only make a few pieces of silver.
That’s worse than Uncle Wang’s carpenter shop. If I’d realized that
earlier, I could have learned some carpentry skills from him. At least
then I wouldn’t be starving like I am now.” He grew silent for a while.
SOOYOuNA | 6
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
“I don’t have much food or money left at home. I owe Steward Zhou
three pieces of silver.
What am I going to do?” He raised his head and looked up at the sky,
blue and grand. It was so large you could not see its ends. Much
similar to how he could not see his future.
After a while, Meng Hao shook his head and took out a slip of paper
from his robe. He read it carefully, placed it in the gourd bottle, then
stood up and threw the gourd down the mountain.
At the bottom of the mountain was a wide river which never froze
during the winter, and was said to flow all the way to the Great Tang.
Meng Hao stood on top of the mountain, watching the gourd bottle
drift further and further along down the river. He stared unblinking.
For a moment, he seemed to have glimpsed his mother, and the
happiness of his childhood. The gourd carried his dreams, his wishes,
and his hopes for the future. Perhaps one day someone would pick it
up, open it, and read the note.
“Regardless of what I do, be it study or work, I will keep living.” This
was his personality: intelligent and determined. If he wasn’t this way,
he would not have been able to survive after his parents left.
He raised his head toward the sky, the stubborn look in his eyes
growing deeper. He was about to head down the mountain.

At that exact moment, he heard a weak voice coming from a nearby
cliff. The sound seemed to be borne along by the wind. As it passed
Meng Hao’s ears, it was almost too faint to notice.
“Help... help...”
Meng Hao stopped for a moment, shocked, then listened carefully. As
he concentrated, the sound of the voice calling for help grew stronger.
“Help...”
He walked a few steps forward until he had nearly reached the edge
of the peak. When he peered over the edge, he saw a person, his
body sticking out of a crevice halfway down the cliff. Pale face full of
fear and desperation, he cried for help.
“You... you’re Meng Hao, right? Help, Scholar Meng! Help me!” It was
a teenager. As soon as he saw Meng Hao, he expressed surprise
and happiness, having suddenly found hope in a desperate situation.
SOOYOuNA | 7
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
“Wang Youcai [5]? ” Meng Hao’s eyes grew wide as he looked at the
young man. He was the son of Uncle Wang, who owned the
carpentry shop in town. “How did you end up here?”
Meng Hao looked at the crevice. The cliff itself was quite steep, and it
seemed impossible to climb down. The slightest carelessness would
send the climber falling into the river.
Considering how fast the river flowed, if you fell in, the chances of
dying were about ninety percent.
“It’s not just me, there are other people from nearby towns,” Wang
Youcai gushed. “We’re all stuck here. Brother Meng, let’s not chat,
please, just help us get out.” Perhaps he had been hanging out of the

crack for too long. His hands grasped at the air, and if not for his
compatriots, who grabbed him by the shirt, he would have slipped
and fell down the cliff. His face turned pale with fear.
Meng Hao realized the danger. But he had climbed the mountain
alone today, and had no rope.
How could he save anyone? At that moment, he turned and realized
that the mountainside was covered with rattan vines.
As frail as he was, it took him two hours to find a rattan vine that was
long enough. Breathing heavily, he dragged the rattan to the cliff.
Calling out Wang’s name, he bent over and lowered the rattan down
the cliff.
“You still haven’t told me how you got down there,” Meng Hao said as
he lowered the vine.
“By flying!” It was not Wang Youcai who spoke the words, but another
young man who stuck his body out of the crevice next to him. This
boy looked feisty and intelligent, and spoke with a loud voice.
“Bullshit! You can fly?” mocked Meng Hao, pulling the rattan vine
back up a bit. “If you can fly down here, then why don’t you fly back
up?”
“Don’t listen to his nonsense,” said Wang Youcai, clearly worried that
Meng Hao wouldn’t lower the rattan vine back down. “We were
captured by a flying woman. She said she’s going to take us to some
Sect to be servants.”
“More bullshit?” said Meng Hao dismissively. “Only Immortals from
legends can do that. Who believes in that?” In books he had read,
there were stories of people who became rich after meeting
Immortals, but it was all just lies.
SOOYOuNA | 8

I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Just as the rattan reached the crevice, Wang caught it. But then,
Meng Hao suddenly felt a cold wind behind his back. From the
temperature around him, it seemed winter had returned. He shivered.
He slowly turned to look back, then screamed and stepped forward
into emptiness, beginning to fall off the cliff.
He had seen a woman in a long silver robe and pale face, standing
there staring at him. It was impossible to tell her age. She was
extremely beautiful, but radiated a coldness that made one feel as if
she had just crawled out of a grave.
“Sometimes when you find certain things with certain qualities, it’s just
fate.”
When the voice hit his ears, it felt like bones rubbing together. This
woman seemed to possess some sort of strange power, and when
Meng Hao looked into her eyes, his whole body felt ice cold, as if she
could see through him. As if he could hide nothing from her.
Her words still floating through the air, she shook her wide sleeve,
and suddenly, a gust of greenish wind picked up Meng Hao. He flew
down the cliff with her. His mind went blank.
When they reached the crevice, the woman waved her hand and
threw him inside. As for her, she stopped moving, as did the greenish
wind. Wang and his three friends scurried backward in fright.
The woman stood there, not saying a word. She raised her head and
glanced at the rattan vine.
Meng Hao was so nervous he had started shaking. He stood up,
glancing around quickly. The crevice was not spacious, and was in
fact quite narrow. Even with only a few people inside, there was not
much room.

His eyes fell on Wang and the two other young men. One was the
clever fellow; the other one was clean and pudgy. The two of them
shivered, looking as if they might cry from fear at any moment.
“I was short one person,” said the pale-faced woman. Now she
looked at Meng Hao instead of the rattan. “I’ll put you in with them.”
“Who are you?” asked Meng Hao, concealing his fear. He was an
educated person and had a strong personality. Despite being afraid,
he controlled himself and did not panic.
The woman said nothing. She raised her right hand and waved, and
the green wind appeared again. It lifted up all the young men, and
they flew out of the cave together with the woman, SOOYOuNA | 9
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
shooting up into the sky. They disappeared. Left behind was only
Mount Daqing. It stood there, straight and tall, merging in the
darkness of twilight.
The blood drained from Meng Hao’s face. He saw himself within the
green wind, crossing the sky. As he flew above the ground, wind blew
into his mouth, making it impossible to breathe.
A word appeared in his head.
“Immortals?” He held his breath for the amount of time it would
normally take to breathe ten times, until he couldn’t hold on any more.
Then he passed out.
When he opened his eyes, he found that they had landed on a
platform paved with green stone, halfway up a mountain. More rolling
mountains surrounded them. Clouds and fog drifted about; this was
definitely not the mortal world. The beautiful peaks of the surrounding
mountains looked very strange.

Wang and the other young men woke up, scared and shivering. They
stared at the back of the woman.
Standing in front of her were two Cultivators wearing long green
robes. They appeared to be in their twenties. They had sunken eyes
with fear-inspiring green pupils.
“Excellent work, Elder Sister Xu,” said one of the men, his voice
flattering. “You found four talented young babies.”
“Take them to the Servants’ Quarter,” said the woman, her face cold,
not even looking at Meng Hao and the others. Suddenly, her entire
body transformed. She became a rainbow and then disappeared into
the mountains.
By this time, Meng Hao had recovered his composure. He stared,
numb, at the place where the woman had disappeared. An
expression appeared on his face which had not appeared there for
sixteen years. His blood boiled.
“Servants?” he thought. “If the work is for Immortals, the pay must be
good.” Now that he knew the people didn’t want to kill them, he took a
step forward.
“Sister Xu has reached the seventh level of Qi Condensation,”
lamented the second of the Cultivators. “The Sect Priest bestowed a
Wind Pennant upon her, which means even though she isn’t at the
Foundation Establishment stage, she can still fly.” He looked
arrogantly down at Meng Hao and the others.
SOOYOuNA | 10

“You and you,” he said pointing at Wang and the clever young man.
“Follow me to the Southern Servants’ Quarters.”

“What is this place?” Wang asked, his voice and body both shaking
as the Immortal pointed at him.
“The Reliance Sect.”
1. The State of Zhao is named after the historical State of Zhao
2. The Great Tang is named after the historical Tang Dynasty
3. Chang’an is named after the historical Chinese city Chang’an
4. Meng Hao’s name in Chinese is 孟浩 (mèng hào) – Meng is a
family name. Hao means
“great” or “many”
5. Wang Youcai’s name in Chinese is 王有才 (wáng yǒu cái) – Wang
is a common family name.
Youcai means “to have talent or ability”

CHAPTER 2: THE RELIANCE SECT
The Reliance Sect, located within the borders of the State of Zhao, on
the southern edge of the Nanshan continent, was once first among
the Four Great Sects. Even though it was still famous in the Southern
Domain, it had experienced a decline in recent years and did not
maintain the glorious position it once had. Nowadays, compared to
the other Sects within the State of Zhao, it could only be considered
inferior.
Actually, it hadn’t always been called the Reliance Sect. But a
thousand years ago, a Cultivator appeared who caused a great
sensation in the Southern Domain. He’d called himself Patriarch

Reliance, and had forced the Sect to change its name as such. He’d
trod roughshod over all the other Sects in the State of Zhao,
plundering their treasures, remaining unrivaled for some time.
But things were different now. Patriarch Reliance had been missing
for nearly 400 years. If it were not for the fact that no one knew if he
was alive or dead, the Sect would already have been swallowed up
by some other Sect. It was past its glory days. Considering the lack of
resources in the State of Zhao, and pressure from the other three
Sects, if they wanted to get new recruits, they were forced to kidnap
people to act as servants. There was no way they could open their
doors to recruit openly.
Meng Hao followed the green-robed man along the small paths that
wound among the mountain peaks. The surroundings were gardenlike, with strange rocks and odd-looking trees everywhere. Amidst the
beautiful scenery, extravagantly decorated buildings with jade roof
tiles rose up out of the clouds and mist. Meng Hao sighed
continuously. Sadly, the fat teenager next to him wailed the entire
time, somewhat ruining the mood.
“I’m finished, really finished.... I want to go home,” muttered the fat
teenager, tears rolling down his face. “There’s mantou waiting at
home, and fish. Dammit, dammit. I want to inherit the family land,
become a rich old man, and have a few concubines. I don’t want to
be a servant here.”
He muttered under his breath for the time it takes to drink half a cup
of tea, until the green-robed man turned. “If you spout one more bit of
nonsense,” he said coldly, “I’ll cut your tongue out.”
The fat teenager suddenly trembled violently, his eyes shining with
fear, but he shut his mouth.
When he saw this, Meng Hao began to reconsider how wonderful the
situation might or might not be. But he had a persistent personality,
so he took a deep breath and maintained his silence.

SOOYOuNA | 12
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
After a while, when they reached a point about half way up the
mountain, Meng Hao saw a row of flat buildings emerging from the
roiling fog.
Seven or eight young people wearing hemp robes sat outside the
buildings. They looked exhausted. As Meng Hao and the others
approached, the young people noticed them, but did not call out any
greetings.
Some distance away, a young man wearing a light blue robe sat on a
crag. His face was long, almost like a horse, and his robe was
obviously more expensive and fancy than those worn by the other
youths. Though his face was cold, when the green-robed man
approached leading Meng Hao, the young man stood and greeted
him with cupped fists.
“Greetings, Elder Brother.”
“These are two newly arrived servants,” said the green-robed man
impatiently. “Please arrange for their accommodations.” With that, he
turned and left, not even glancing at Meng Hao and the other young
man.
After he left, the horse-faced young man sat down again, crossing his
legs and coldly glancing over Meng Hao and the fat teenager.
“This is the Northern Servants’ Quarter,” he said in a cold,
emotionless voice. “The Reliance Sect does not support slackers.
Now that you’re here, you will work for thirty years, upon which you
can leave. If you try to escape, well, there are many wild beasts in
these lonely mountains, and you will certainly die. Go retrieve your
work uniform. From now on, you are isolated from the mortal world,
and will work peacefully as a servant.”

The fat teenager trembled even harder, his face filling with despair.
Meng Hao remained calm.
In fact, deep within his eyes was an indescribable sparkle. The horsefaced man noticed. He had held this position for many years and had
seen many young people captured to be servants, but had never
seen anyone as calm as Meng Hao.
“If you have a good temperament,” he said lightly, “you may not need
to labor for the full thirty years. You can practice cultivation in your
time off. If you manage to reach the first level of Qi Condensation,
then you will be promoted to the Outer Sect.” He flicked his wide
sleeve, whereupon two hemp robes appeared in front of Meng Hao
and the fat teenager. On the front of each robe was a wooden badge
the size of a thumb, engraved with the character “Servant.”
In addition to the robe, there was also a small booklet, upon the cover
of which was written three characters: “Qi Condensation Manual.”
SOOYOuNA | 13
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
As soon as Meng Hao laid eyes on the characters, he began to
breathe hard. He stared at the booklet and recalled how when
discussing the cold-faced woman, the green-robed man had
mentioned the seventh level of Qi Condensation.
“We can become Outer Sect disciples when we reach the first level,
but that woman has already reached the seventh level... what is Qi
Condensation? Perhaps that is the way to become an Immortal, like
they talk about in stories.”
If that was the pay he would receive from his work, well, it might not
be money, but it would be worth hundreds of pieces of gold in the
outside world. Meng Hao’s excitement rose. He grabbed the robe and
used it to wrap up the badge and booklet.

“The East Seventh house is where you will live. Starting tomorrow,
your job is to cut wood. Ten logs each, every day. You are not
permitted to eat until your chopping is finished.” He closed his eyes.
Breathing deeply, Meng Hao imitated the young man and saluted with
clasped fists, then walked toward the house, followed by the fat
teenager. The building appeared to be a siheyuan courtyard dwelling
that had been expanded multiple times. Following the signs, they
located the seventh one, then opened the door and entered.
The room wasn’t large. It contained a table and two small beds, and
though simple, was quite neat and tidy. The fat teenager sat down on
one of the beds, then, unable to hold it in anymore, began to cry.
He was about 12 or 13 years old, and he cried loudly. It surely
echoed outside.
“My father is a Lord, and I’m supposed to be a Lord too. I’m not
supposed to be a servant.” He seemed extremely distraught, and his
fat little body trembled.
“Stop crying,” said Meng Hao, trying to comfort him. “Think about it.
It’s not that bad here.
We’re working for Immortals. How many people would envy us if they
knew?” He quickly closed the door.
“I don’t want to work for other people,” he replied. “My marriage has
already been arranged and engagement gifts sent. My poor, beautiful
lady hasn’t even married me, yet is already a widow.” The more he
cried, the more heartbroken he grew.
A strange expression appeared on Meng Hao’s face. This fat
teenager was still young, he thought to himself. I can’t believe he’s
been promised a wife, yet has never even felt the touch of a woman’s
hand. He sighed emotionally, thinking about how amazing it would be
to be rich.

This fat teenager’s family is so rich that he never has to worry about
food or clothing. And yet SOOYOuNA | 14
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
I have nothing. Even after selling my ancestral home last year, I still
owe Steward Zhou a lot of money.
Thinking of the money he owed made him laugh. Now that he was
here, Zhou could come to chase after him for the money if he was
strong enough. If not, he would be dead by the time Meng Hao left.
The more he thought about this place, the better he felt about it. He
didn’t need to worry about money, or lodging or food. He even got
payment worth hundreds of pieces of gold, and that was before he
even started working. Considering that this was a dwelling-place of
Immortals, it could truly be said that he had unexpectedly been
rescued from a desperate situation.
The fat teenager’s crying had begun to annoy him. Ignoring him, he
pulled the manual out from the hemp robe and started reading. After
reading the first line of the first page, he felt shocked.
“A person should have something to rely on. If you are a mortal who
desires riches and titles, if you are a Cultivator who wants to live a life
free from worry, join my Reliance Sect. You can rely on me.” That was
the introduction to the manual, and it was signed by Patriarch
Reliance.
Even though it was only a handful of words, they were filled with an
indescribable power. It was both an invitation and a description of the
Reliance Sect. Meng Hao felt numb, and then, everything suddenly
made sense.
“The Reliance Sect. Is this the meaning of the Sect? People must find
something to rely on; when they find the Reliance Sect, then they will
be rich, powerful and free from worry.” It made more and more sense.

He realized that if he’d had an official to rely on, he would never have
failed the examinations three times in a row. He sighed, his respect
growing for Patriarch Reliance, whom he had never actually met.
With that one sentence, it seemed as if a door in his life had suddenly
opened.
“In other words, I have to find someone to rely on while I’m here. If I
do, I won’t have to worry about anything.” His eyes grew brighter as
he continued to scan the manual. Soon, he lost track of time, and
didn’t even notice the fat teenager crying next to him.
The fat teenager finally cried himself to sleep around midnight,
whereupon his snores began to reverberate around the room like
thunder. Meng Hao reluctantly closed the manual. Even though he
felt very tired, his eyes were filled with vim and vigor.
“This book isn’t worth 100 gold, it’s worth 1,000!” he said to himself.
For someone who had always dreamed of becoming a rich official,
something worth 1,000 gold was worth more than anything except his
life.
SOOYOuNA | 15
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
In his excitement, he noticed that the fat teenager’s snoring had
ceased. He looked over, and saw that the young man had sat up in
bed and was waving his arms around and muttering.
“I’m gonna beat you to death! How dare you steal my mantou! I’m
gonna bite you to death!
How dare you steal away my wife!” As he talked, he got off the bed,
his eyes still closed, waving his fists angrily. Then, amazingly, he
grabbed the table and bit the corner hard with his mouth, leaving a
deep mark. Then he went back to sleep and began to snore.

Meng Hao watched him for a bit, just to confirm that he had been
sleepwalking just now. Then he looked back to the bite mark,
realizing that he should never provoke the fat teenager when he was
asleep. He inched away from him, then looked down at the manual
again, feeling excited.
“The ninth level of Qi Condensation is the path to being an Immortal.
Working for them, I have a chance to become an Immortal myself.
That is the biggest payment possible. If I become an Immortal, I must
have a chance to become rich.” Meng Hao gripped the manual, his
eyes shining brightly. He had finally found another path besides
studying for the exams.
At that moment, the door was kicked open with a bang, and a loud
“harumph” sounded out.

CHAPTER 3: PROMOTION TO THE OUTER SECT
“You went to sleep early. Now it’s time to wake up for Grandpa Tiger!”
The door shook as it opened, and a tall, strong man entered wearing
servants’ robes. He glared fiercely at Meng Hao and the fat teenager.
“Starting today,” he said angrily, “you two little bastards will chop ten
trees per day for me, each. Otherwise, Grandpa Tiger will flay you
alive.”
“Greetings, Grandpa Tiger,” said Meng Hao, scrambling off the bed
and standing there nervously. “Maybe you could quiet down a...”
Before he could finish speaking, the large man fixed his eyes on him.
“Quiet farts! You think I’m speaking too loud?”
Looking at his fierce bearing and large stature, Meng Hao hesitated,
then said, “But... the Elder Brother in charge of servants already

assigned us to chop down ten trees per day.”
“Then chop an extra ten for me,” he said with a cold harrumph.
Though Meng Hao said nothing, his brain spun. He had just arrived in
the Immortal’s Sect, and was already being bullied. He didn’t want to
give in, but the man was so big and strong, and he himself was
clearly too weak, unable to fight back. Then he glanced at the table,
and noticed the bite marks. Thinking back to how strong the fat
teenager had been in the clutches of his dream walking, he had a
flash of inspiration. He suddenly yelled at the sleeping fat teenager.
“Fatty! Someone’s stealing your mantou and your girl!”
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, the fat teenager sat up,
eyes closed, shouting, his face twisted with furious savagery.
“Who’s stealing my mantou? Who’s stealing my wife?” he cried,
leaping out of the bed. “I’ll beat you to death! I’ll bite you to death!” He
began striking randomly around the room. The big man stared in
shock, then took a step forward and made to slap the boy.
“You dare to shout in front of Grandpa Tiger!” His slap landed on the
boy’s face, but then the big man cried out. The fat teenager, eyes
closed, had bitten down onto the man’s arm. No matter how the man
shook his arm, the boy refused to let go.
SOOYOuNA | 17
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
“Stop biting me, dammit. Stop biting.” This man was a servant, not a
Cultivator. He had been a servant for a long time, and his body was
strong, but the pain had caused him to break out in a cold sweat. He
punched and kicked, but couldn’t make the fat teenager loosen his
jaw even the slightest bit. The harder he hit, the deeper the boy bit.

The man’s flesh was mangled, and it seemed as if a chunk were
about to be ripped off.
His screams drifted outside, such that others began to notice. A cold
voice shouted out.
“What’s the ruckus?”
It was the voice of the horse-faced young man. As soon as the big
man heard it, he began to tremble in fear. Despite the horrible pain
which twisted his face, he ceased his screaming.
“It’s not a good idea to upset the Elder Brother in charge of servants,”
said the big man hurriedly. “There’s no benefit to continuing this.
Quick, stop biting me! I don’t need the ten logs.”
Meng Hao never imagined the fat teenager’s dream state would be
so intense, and also wanted to stop the situation. He walked forward
and lightly slapped the fat teenager, then whispered into his ear.
“The mantou is back, and so is your girl.”
The young man suddenly relaxed and released his jaw. Continuing to
punch the air, he returned to his bed, his face covered in blood, then
fell back to sleep.
Giving another nervous glance toward the fat teenager, the big man
left without saying another word.
Meng Hao stood there for a while gaping, admiring the fat teenager,
then returned to bed with the greatest of care and went back to sleep.
The following morning at dawn.
As the morning sun filled the sky, the sound of bells filled the air. It
seemed to carry with it a strange power; as people heard it, they
woke and began their work. The fat teenager woke up.

He looked down dumbly at the marks on his body. He touched his
face.
“What happened last night? How come my whole body hurts? Did
someone beat me up?”
SOOYOuNA | 18
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Meng Hao dressed silently for a while before speaking.
“Nothing happened. Everything seemed normal.”
“How come my face feels swollen?”
“Maybe it’s mosquitos.”
“Then how come my mouth has blood on it?”
“You fell out of bed last night. Several times, in fact.” Meng Hao
opened the door and stepped out, then stopped and looked back.
“Look, fatty,” he said in a serious tone, “you need to grind your teeth
more often, sharpen them up.”
“Oh? My dad used to say the same thing,” he said in surprise,
gingerly putting on his robes.
Meng Hao and the fat teenager walked out into the sunlight and
began their life as servants in the Reliance Sect, chopping down
trees.
Each of them was responsible for ten trees. Around the Northern
Servants’ Quarter, the wild slopes were covered with trees. Although
the trees were not big, they were very dense and spread like an
ocean as far as the eye could see.

Carrying his servant’s axe, Meng Hao rubbed at his shoulder. His arm
felt both numb and painful. The axe was heavy. Off to the side, the fat
teenager panted as they climbed. Eventually, they found a suitable
area, and the sound of chopping axes gradually rang out as they
began to work.
“My dad is super rich,” said the fat teenager with a long face. He
raised his axe. “I’m gonna be super rich too. I don’t want to be a
servant... These Immortals are strange, and they have magic.
What do they need fire for? And why do they need us to chop down
trees for them?”
Unlike the garrulous fat teenager, Meng Hao was too tired to speak.
Sweat showered off of him like rain. Because of his poverty in Yunjie
County, he hadn’t been able to eat much meat and as such his body
was weak. He didn’t have much energy. After the space of time it
takes half an incense stick to burn, he leaned up against a tree,
breathing heavily.
He looked at the fat teenager, who, though he was so tired he
trembled, he continued to curse under his breath and chop at the
tree. He was younger than Meng Hao, but a lot stronger.
SOOYOuNA | 19
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Meng Hao shook his head bitterly and continued to rest. He pulled
out the Qi Condensation Manual and examined it again. Following the
description in the manual, he attempted to sense the spiritual energy
of Heaven and Earth.
Time passed, and soon it was dusk. In his day of work, Meng Hao
had managed to cut down two trees. The fat teenager had managed
to cut down eight. By pooling them together, it was enough for one of
them to eat. They consulted for a bit, and then the fat teenager went

to get some food which the two of them shared in their room. Then
they fell to sleep, exhausted.
Eventually, the fat teenager’s snores filled the room, and Meng Hao
struggled to sit up, his eyes filled with determination. Ignoring his
hunger and exhaustion, he picked up the Qi Condensation Manual
and started reading it again.
“When I used to study for the examinations, I would usually stay up
reading until dawn. I’m used to being hungry. As for my life now, it
may be tiring, but at least I have a goal. I can’t believe that after
failing in the Imperial examinations, I will fail in Cultivation.” Stubborn
persistence shone in his eyes. He lowered his head and began to
study.
He continued on until late in the night, until he finally fell asleep,
although when exactly that was, he didn’t know. As he slept, his
dreams were filled with thoughts of sensing the spiritual energy of
heaven and earth. The bells woke him up in the morning. He opened
his bloodshot eyes, yawned, and got out of bed. Then, along with the
energetic fat teenager, went back to chopping wood.
A day, two day, three days... time continued on until two months had
passed. Meng Hao’s wood-felling ability slowly grew until he could
chop down four trees in a day. But, most of his time was spent trying
to grasp the meaning of spiritual energy. His eyes grew more and
more bloodshot. Then one evening around dusk, as he sat panting in
mediation, his body suddenly vibrated, and he felt a prickling
numbness in his limbs. Then, it seemed as if tiny wisp of invisible Qi
condensed within his flesh and blood, then seeped out of his body.
After that, he felt a strand of spiritual energy appear inside him. It
disappeared almost instantly, but Meng Hao opened his eyes
excitedly. His exhaustion disappeared, and his bloodshot eyes grew
whiter. His body trembling, he clutched at the Qi Condensation
Manual.

He hadn’t eaten or slept much in the past months. Other than
chopping down trees, he spent almost all his time on spiritual energy,
and now, at long last, he had some results. He felt as if he were filled
with power.
Time passed in a flash, two months, and now it was the eighth month
of the year, summer.
Broiling sunlight fell from the sky.
“Condense the Qi into the body, fuse and disperse it, open the blood
vessels and Qi passages, resonate with heaven and earth.” It was
noontime in the deep mountains near the Reliance SOOYOuNA | 20
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Sect. Meng Hao used one hand to stoke the bonfire in front of him,
and the other to hold the Qi Condensation Manual, which he studied
intently.
He closed his eyes for the time it takes an incense stick to burn,
sensing the delicate strand of Qi within his body. This was the Qi
which had appeared two months ago, and Meng Hao regarded it as a
treasure. The strand was clearly much thicker now. Using the
mnemonics and circulation technique described in the manual, he sat
in meditation, allowing the Qi strand to move about his body.
After a short time, Meng Hao opened his eyes and caught sight of the
fat teenager approaching quickly, carrying his axe.
“Well, how is it?” panted the fat teenager as he ran up. Though fat,
his body was strong.
“I still can’t disseminate it throughout my entire body,” said Meng Hao
with a laugh. “But I’m quite confident that within a month, I’ll be able
to reach the first stage of Qi Condensation.”
Belief filled his demeanor.

“What I meant was, how is the chicken?” He licked his lips as he
looked at the bonfire.
“Oh, pretty much done,” said Meng Hao, also licking his lips and
pulling back the branch he’d been using to stoke the fire. The fat
teenager used his axe to dig through the soil and pull the chicken out.
It was fully cooked now.
A fragrant aroma filled the air. They split the chicken in half and
began to wolf it down.
“Ever since you were able to get some spiritual energy,” said the fat
teenager, his lips covered in grease, “you’ve been able to catch wild
chickens. Compared to now, the first two months here were like a
nightmare...” This was his new practice, to flatter Meng Hao.
“A lot of people get food out in the wild, you just don’t know about it,
that’s all.” As Meng Hao spoke, he took a bite out of a chicken leg,
making his speech a bit garbled.
“Ai, if you really reach the first level of Qi Condensation next week
and become an Outer Sect disciple,” said the fat teenager, his face
bitter, “then what will I do? I don’t understand any of those
mnemonics.” He looked at Meng Hao expectantly.
“Look fatty, the only way you can get home is if you become an Outer
Sect disciple,” said Meng Hao, dropping the chicken leg and looking
him in the eye.
SOOYOuNA | 21
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
The fat teenager sat quietly for a while before giving a determined
nod.
Six days flew by. It was night. The fat teenager was already asleep,
and Meng Hao sat cross-legged in his room, meditating. He thought

about how other than wood-chopping, he had spent all his time these
past three months in sensing spiritual energy. He thought back to two
months ago, when the strand of Qi had first stirred within him. He
breathed deeply, closing his eyes and causing the strand of spiritual
energy to circulate throughout his body. Then, a loud sound
reverberated in his head. Up to now, he had been unable to disperse
the Qi throughout his entire body. But just now, he had succeeded,
diffusing the Qi to every corner of his body.
He felt as if his body were floating.
At the same moment in which Meng Hao achieved the first level of Qi
Condensation, the horse-faced young man sitting on the big stone
outside slowly opened his eyes. He looked in the direction of Meng
Hao’s house, then closed his eyes again.
At dawn, under the envious eyes of everyone in the Northern
Servants’ quarter, Meng Hao walked out of the room that had been
his home for the past four months. He stood in front of the horsefaced youth.
The fat teenager didn’t come with him. He remained in the doorway
watching Meng Hao, determination filling his eyes.
“You reached the first level of Qi Condensation in four months. You’re
not quite outstanding, but not stupid, either.” The horse-faced young
man looked at him, his expression no longer cold. Calmly, he said,
“Now that you are going to the Outer Sect, I must explain to you the
rules there. Every month, Spirit Stones and medicinal pills will be
distributed there, but it is not prohibited to take things by force from
others, or to gang up. There is a Public Area there that some people
call the Killing Zone. You... you will need to look out for yourself.” As
he finished speaking, he lifted his right hand, whereupon a jade slip
shot out and hovered in front of Meng Hao. He grabbed it.
“Imbue spiritual energy into that jade slip and it will lead you to the
Treasure Pavilion in the Outer Sect. That is where you will register

your promotion.” The horse-faced young man closed his eyes.
Meng Hao said nothing. Clasping his fist in salute, he turned and
glanced at the fat teenager.
They looked at each other for a moment, and Meng Hao felt emotion
welling up in his heart.
He chose not to dwell on it. He pinched the jade slip, which then
began to glow with a green light, and gradually floated forward.
Meng Hao followed it, slowly leaving the Servants’ Quarter.
SOOYOuNA | 22
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
He trod a narrow road which led away from the main gate, walking
further and further away, toward the foot of the mountain. Eventually
he reached an area he had never stepped foot into during the past
four months.
The Reliance Sect was comprised of four main mountains, with east,
west, north and south peaks, respectively. Surrounding them were
vast mountain chains which seemed to never end.
At the halfway point up each mountain was a Servants’ Quarter.
Meng Hao had been assigned to the Northern Servant’s quarter on
the Northern Mountain. The way further up was protected by
defensive spells. Beyond them lived the Inner Sect disciples and
elders.
Each of the four mountains was like this. As for the flat area inbetween them all, it was filled with countless houses inhabited by the
Reliance Sect’s Outer Sect.
In this respect, the Reliance Sect was slightly different that other
Sects. The Outer Sect was located at the foot of the mountain,

whereas the servants lived halfway up. This was a sect rule created
for unknown reasons by Patriarch Reliance.
From a distance, the entire area seemed to be filled with roiling fog.
However, upon stepping foot into the fog, it disappeared. In front of
him stretched a scene of carved balustrades and marble steps, of
lofty buildings and roads paved with green stone. Outer Sect disciples
bustled about wearing green robes. A few of them noticed Meng Hao
as he walked past.
Some of them shot him contemptuous glances which lacked even the
slightest bit of good intent. He felt as if he were being stared at by
wild beasts, which caused him to recall what Elder Brother Horseface had said about the Outer Sect.
Not long after that, he reached a black building in the southern
section of the Outer Sect. It was three stories tall, and despite being
black, appeared to have been carved from jade, and almost seemed
to be transparent.
As Meng Hao approached, the building’s main door opened
noiselessly and out walked a wizened, middle-aged man. He wore a
long robe of deep green, and a shrewd expression covered his face.
He lifted his right hand in a grabbing motion, and the jade slip flew
into his hand. He looked at it then began to speak languidly:
“Meng Hao has been promoted to the Outer Sect. He shall be
bestowed with a house, a green robe, a spirit tablet, and a bag of
holding. The spirit tablet can be used to enter the Treasure Pavilion to
retrieve a magic item.” He waved his right hand, and a gray bag
appeared in Meng Hao’s hands.
He looked at the gray bag for a moment, then thought back to one of
the Outer Sect disciples he’d passed on the road. That man had a
bag just like this hanging at his waist.
SOOYOuNA | 23

I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
The shrewd-looking man looked at Meng Hao, and could instantly tell
that he was not familiar at all with the ways of the Outer Sect.
Otherwise, how could he be unfamiliar with a bag of holding? Feeling
a bit bad for him, he coolly said, “By imbuing the bag with spiritual
energy, you can pack many things into it.”
Having heard this, Meng Hao imbued the bag with a sizable amount
of spiritual energy. It grew blurry, and then he caught a glimpse of a
space inside about half the size of a person. There, he could see a
green robe, a jade slip, and some other objects.
At this point, his interest was quite piqued. This bag of holding must
be worth at least a hundred gold. It clearly was the product of
Immortal hands.
He concentrated, and the jade slip suddenly appeared in his hand.
He focused his attention even more and found that inside the bag
was a map of the Outer Sect Quarter. In a remote corner was his
house.
“Go look at it later,” said the shrewd-looking man coldly. “The
Treasure Pavilion is open and you haven’t entered it yet.”
Meng Hao lifted his head and stuffed the bag of holding into his robe.
Looking at the opened door of the Treasure Pavilion, he sucked in a
deep breath and stepped in, filled with anticipation.
As soon as he entered, his expression changed, and he sucked in a
breath.

CHAPTER 4: A COPPER MIRROR

The Treasure Pavilion was indeed filled with treasure. Upon entering
it, one’s eye would be dazzled with brilliant lights. Neatly arranged
jade shelves were filled with a dazzling display of bottles, swords,
ornaments and jewelry. Meng Hao began breathing heavily, and his
heart started pumping. It felt as if all the blood in his body had rushed
to his brain. He stood there, dumbfounded.
In Meng Hao’s short life, he had never seen so much wealth. He felt
as if it had submerged him.
His brain spun, and he inadvertently thought about grabbing all of it
and running away.
“The value of these treasures...” murmured Meng Hao, “... they’re
priceless. The compensation for working for Immortals, it’s
incredible.” He walked past one of the jade shelves, his expression
filled with excitement, unconsciously stretching his head forward. He
wondered if the third floor of the Treasure Pavilion was the same as
the first, or if it perhaps had even more valuable treasures.
“Immortals... they’re so rich!” Meng Hao heaved a deep sigh.
Suddenly, his eyes fell upon something strange. On one of the jade
shelves he noticed a copper mirror.
There were traces of corrosion on it. It didn’t seem very special, nor
did it glitter. It didn’t seem like it could compare in any way to the
treasures around it.
Surprised, Meng Hao picked it up and looked at it closely. It seemed
quite ordinary, like something from the mortal world. Nothing about it
seemed the least bit unique. And yet, here it was in the Treasure
Pavilion, so he assumed it must have some value.
“Junior Brother truly has insight,” said a voice from behind him. He
didn’t know when the shrewd-looking man had entered, but he stood
there looking at the copper mirror. His voice filled with praise, he
continued, “The fact that you picked up that copper mirror shows that

you were destined to do so. There are many legends regarding it.
The strangest thing is, only those with good fortune and accumulated
good deeds in past lives can acquire it. It seems Junior Brother is just
such a person. With this mirror, you can lord it over heaven and earth.
You definitely have this opportunity.” As the man spoke, he sighed
over and over. His voice seemed to contain some strange power
which forced Meng Hao to listen to him.
“This mirror...” Meng Hao looked down at it again, a strange
expression on his face. It was not covered with complicated carvings,
but instead, corrosion, making it very unclear.
“Junior Brother, don’t look at the mirror’s blurriness. You should know
that true treasures of a spiritual nature often conceal themselves in
ordinary things. The more humble they appear, SOOYOuNA | 25
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
the more precious they are.” Meng Hao was about to put the copper
mirror back onto the shelf when the shrewd-looking man took several
hasty steps forward to prevent him. He looked seriously at Meng Hao.
“Junior Brother, the fact that you picked up this object shows that you
were destined to do so.
Will you really put it back just because it looks ordinary? I have been
responsible for the Treasure Pavilion for many years, and I know the
origin of all the items here. Many years ago, this copper mirror
caused a huge commotion in the State of Zhao. It was created from a
ray of light which fell from the Heavens. After acquiring it, Patriarch
Reliance studied it in secret, believing it to be a treasure of the
Heavens. In the end, he couldn’t unlock its mysteries, and came to
the conclusion that it was predestined to fall into the hands of
someone who would use it to trample upon heaven and earth.”

It startled Meng Hao to hear the name of Patriarch Reliance. He had
just entered the Outer Sect, and there were many things he wasn’t
familiar with. He began to hesitate.
“Patriarch Reliance studied it, but couldn’t understand it. I...”
“Your words are incorrect, Junior Brother. Allow Elder Brother to
explain: Patriarch Reliance’s lack of success in his studies proves
that there is something unique and unusual about this treasure.
Before you, ten or more people took it to study it, and though none of
them succeeded in understanding it, none of them regretted their
decision.
“What if... what if you are the person destined to possess the mirror?
In any case, if you take it, you can rest at ease. Of your fellow
disciples who took the mirror in the past, most came back within three
months, and I let them exchange it for something else. After dealing
with me for some time, you will find that I am very easy-going. I don’t
want to give fellow disciples a hard time.
“If you take it, but are unable to unlock its mysteries, then you can
return it at any time and exchange it for something else. But if you
abandon it, and it turns out you were destined to take it, then you will
regret it for your entire life.” The shrewd-looking man stared intently at
Meng Hao. When he saw Meng Hao hesitating, he laughed to
himself. The new disciples were always the easiest to toy with. All he
had to do was tell them the story of the mirror’s legend, and the grand
words would seduce them. Their hearts would begin to boil.
“But...” Meng had studied and read from childhood, so he was quite
intelligent. From the shrewd-looking man’s seemingly earnest
expression, he could conjecture that the mirror was not exactly as
had been described. But, the man stood there in front of him, clearly
determined to prevent him from putting back the mirror. Even
dropping it to the ground would be of little use. He began to regret
picking it up in the first place.

“Junior Brother,” he said, his face stern, his voice low, “don’t violate
the rules on your first day.
When you pick something up in the Treasure Pavilion, you are not
permitted to put it down.”
SOOYOuNA | 26
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
The shrewd-looking man felt that enough was enough. This was his
usual method to get people to take the mirror. He waved his wide
sleeve, and a whistling wind picked up Meng Hao, flew him out of the
Treasure Pavilion, and deposited him outside.
There was a crashing sound as the main door of the Treasure
Pavilion slammed shut.
The voice of the shrew-looking man echoed from inside: “I’m softhearted when it comes to fellow disciples. If you truly are not destined
to have the mirror, then you can return it in a few days.”
Frowning angrily, Meng Hao looked up at the closed door. Then he
sighed and looked back down at the copper mirror in his hands. He
thought back to the words in the first chapter of the Qi Condensation
Manual and hesitated. If this truly was something that Patriarch
Reliance had studied, then it must have some value. Shaking his
head, he put the mirror into his robe.
Then, with a final hateful glare at the Treasure Pavilion, he turned and
left.
He walked along the green paths of the Outer Sect, using the
information from the jade slip as a guide. Around noontime, he found
his house. It was along the north border, in a very remote section of
the Outer Sect. Several other houses crowded around it.

He pushed the door open, and it slammed against the wall. Inside
were a bed and a desk. Meng Hao stood there, feeling quite content.
This place was much better than his room in the Servants’ Quarter.
He sat down cross-legged on the bed, took a deep breath and pulled
the copper mirror out of his robe. He studied it carefully, until the sun
began to set over the western mountains. He lit an oil lamp and
continued to study it, all to no avail. He had no idea what the purpose
of the mirror could be.
No matter how he looked at it, the copper mirror seemed completely
ordinary in nature.
When the night grew deep, Meng Hao put the mirror to the side and
looked out the window at the moon. He thought about the fat
teenager and his snoring. He missed it a little bit.
The bright moon shone outside, its rays touching the eaves of his
window. Everything was silent, save for the sound of the wind among
the leaves of the trees. Meng Hao took a deep breath, thinking about
the moon. He felt emotional, as if he had entered a new age.
He murmured to himself: “I will never again be a scholar in Yunjie
County. I’ve become a Reliance Outer Sect disciple...”
SOOYOuNA | 27
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Meng Hao gathered his thoughts, closed his eyes, and sat in
meditation, circulating the thread of spiritual energy in his body. He
had been living in this fashion for months now, and was used to it.
One difference between the Outer Sect and the Servants’ Quarter
was that here, no one prepared food for you. You had to take care of
your own food needs. If you didn’t, you would starve to death and no

one would care a whit. Although, in all the years, no one in the
Reliance Outer Sect had ever starved to death.
Upon reaching the first stage of Qi Condensation, one could absorb
and emit the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth. Though that could
not alleviate hunger, it could sustain your life.
Several days passed. One afternoon, Meng Hao sat cross-legged in
meditation, when he suddenly heard a miserable scream from
outside. He immediately opened his eyes, moved to the window and
looked outside. He saw an Outer Sect disciple on the ground, being
stamped upon over and over again by another. Blood oozed from a
wound in his chest, but he wasn’t dead, just wounded. The person
who had been kicking him grabbed his bag of holding, then walked off
with a cold harrumph.
The trampled disciple struggled to his feet, his eyes filled with violent
ruthlessness. He staggered away. Surrounding onlookers stared at
him coldly, their faces filled with ridicule.
Meng Hao observed silently. He had watched similar scenes played
out countless times in the past few days, and as such had a deeper
understanding of the ways of the Outer Sect.
Time blurred as seven days passed. During that time, Meng Hao saw
even more instances of disciples being robbed. The fighting and
plundering which occurred between Outer Sect disciples caused
Meng Hao to grow more and more taciturn. Especially disturbing was
when he had seen a disciple of the second or third level of Qi
Condensation killed by another in the Public Area. This caused Meng
Hao to be especially careful and cautious when he went outside.
Thankfully, his Cultivation base was low, and he didn’t have anything
of value, so others mostly ignored him.
Actually, Meng Hao had reached a standstill in his Cultivation. The
second level of Qi Condensation was different than the first. He still

needed spiritual energy, but according to the Qi Condensation
Manual, his mortal body had already begun to change. As such,
reaching the second level of Qi Condensation would require many
more times the amount of spiritual energy than the first level did.
Similarly, Meng Hao now understood what latent talent was. The
body’s ability to absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth was
just that, latent talent. The more latent talent someone has, the more
energy they could absorb. The less latent talent one has, the less
energy SOOYOuNA | 28
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
they could absorb. For someone with considerable latent talent, the
more time they spent on breathing exercises, the more spiritual
energy they could absorb.
According to his calculations, to reach the second level of Qi
Condensation would probably take at least one or two years. The
amount of time required to reach the third level would be many more
times than that.
Of course, if he acquired some medicinal pills or Spirit Stones, he
could use them to amplify spiritual energy, then, he could decrease
that time. That was why so much horrific robbery occurred in the
Outer Sect; every month, pills would be openly distributed.
“The strong become stronger, the weak become weaker,” said Meng
Hao quietly. “This is how the Reliance Sect grooms disciples for the
Inner Sect.”
One early morning, when the sky had just begun to grow dim with
light, Meng Hao sat in meditation as usual. He had no special
resources, except for his determination. Therefore, he did not give up
on his nightly meditations and breathing exercises. Bells reverberated
throughout the Sect, and Meng Hao slowly opened his eyes.

“These bells...” Meng Hao’s eyes focused, as if he had come to a
realization. An excited expression appeared on his face, and he
dashed out of the room to see fellow disciples everywhere, rushing
off into the distance.
“When these bells sound, the time has come for distribution of Spirit
Stones and medicinal pills. It must be today.” More and more people
began running in the direction of the bells. It seemed everyone within
the Outer Sect was there.
“Pill Distribution Day,” said Meng Hao, breathing heavily. He ran along
with the crowds until he reached the square in the center of the Outer
Sect. The square was monumental in size, and along its borders
were nine stone pillars covered in carvings of dragons. Placed on the
foremost pillar was a platform over ninety meters in diameter, over
which swirled a multicolored cloud. Inside the cloud could be seen
shapeless forms.
Over a hundred Outer Sect disciples stood there in their green robes,
murmuring amongst themselves and glancing frequently at the multicolored cloud.
Then, the cloud slowly dissipated, revealing a pock-faced old man
wearing a golden robe. His face was placid and emitted a calm,
natural power and dignity. His eyes shone like lightning.
Two people stood next to him, a man and a woman, both wearing
silver robes. The man was exceedingly handsome, with an upright
appearance, although indifference covered his face.
As for the woman, as soon as Meng Hao laid eyes on her, his pupils
constricted.

CHAPTER 5: THIS KID ISN’T BAD!
“It turns out Master Uncle Shangguan is distributing the pills himself,
along with Inner Sect disciples Elder Sister Xu and Elder Brother
Chen. They all came. You don’t see this very often.
Don’t tell me there’s an Individual Pill Distribution this time?”
“It must be. Look, Elder Brother Han Zong [1] is here. He’s the
second-ranked disciple in the Outer Sect. His Cultivation base has
reached the fifth level of Qi Condensation. If he can reach the
seventh level, then he will automatically become an Inner Sect
disciple. Too bad Elder Brother Wang Tengfei [2] isn’t here.”
“Considering Elder Brother Wang Tengfei’s abilities, he wouldn’t care
a whit about medicinal pills. The year he joined the Sect, he caused a
big sensation amongst the Sect Elders. He probably doesn’t want to
violate Sect etiquette, so he’ll rely only on himself to enter the Inner
Sect. Then there will finally be a third Inner Sect disciple.”
“Heh heh, this is gonna be fun. With Individual Pill Distribution, there’s
a twenty-four hour period of sealing in which the pill can’t be used.
Every two hours, the pill glows brightly.
Anyone who wants to fight for it will be able to determine its location.
Even if you grab the pill and run, you won’t be able to keep it hidden
for twenty-four hours.”
Meng Hao listened to the discussions around him. Even though it was
his first time taking part in this sort of thing, he knew whenever pills

were distributed, there was a lot of fighting. In his half a month here,
he had seen plenty of fights and even some deaths.
If today was really an Individual Pill Distribution day, then the fighting
would be even more intense.
Meng Hao remained silent. Considering he was at the first level of Qi
Condensation, there was no way he would end up with the pill. Just
looking at the greedy faces around him gave him a deeper
understanding of the expression “the law of the jungle.”
“Quiet!” said the old man in the gold robe. His voice was cold as he
stood on the platform, and though he didn’t speak loudly, his voice
reverberated like a booming thunderclap. The Cultivators standing
below him were shocked to the core. Their ears hummed. Meng Hao
was the most shocked of all, and it took him some time to recover.
“I am Shangguan Xiu [3]. Today, everyone in attendance will receive
one Spirit Condensation pill, and half a Spirit Stone.” Shangguan Xiu
flicked his right arm, and immediately, hundreds of medicinal pills and
Spirit Stones flew about in all directions. They landed perfectly in front
of everyone present. Meng Hao gazed at the medicinal pill and Spirit
Stone floating in front of SOOYOuNA | 31
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
him. A fragrant, intoxicating aroma washed over him. This was his
first time ever seeing a medicinal pill or a Spirit Stone.
The Spirit Stone was about the size of his fingernail, sparkling and
almost translucent. Just looking at it could mystify a person.
His heart began to beat rapidly. These two items must be worth
thousands of pieces of gold.
Without any hesitation, Meng Hao reached out and grabbed the pill.
He was about to pop it into his mouth and swallow it down when he

noticed that no one around him was doing any such thing. His heart
lurched. He looked down at the pill in his hand and noticed that it had
a faint glow to it, and was sealed with a strange mark.
As Meng Hao stared at the pill in his hand, Shangguan Xiu’s voice
once again rang out from the platform: “There is also... a Dry Spirit
Pill.” A purple-colored medicinal pill could be seen in his hand.
As soon as it appeared, a wonderful fragrance filled the entire square.
Even just breathing it, Meng Hao felt as if his spiritual energy had
increased a bit. This was clearly no ordinary pill.
“That’s... a Dry Spirit Pill!”
“That’s... that’s something incredibly precious to anyone under the
fifth level of Qi Condensation. There can’t be many within the Sect,
and yet, there it is!”
“When that pill is distributed, the fighting here in the Outer Sect will be
fierce. Who knows how many people will die?” The crowd buzzed as
they stared up at the glowing pill held by Shangguan Xiu, their faces
filled with greed and desire. This was especially true of disciples who
were on the brink of breaking through to a new level of cultivation.
They fairly panted.
“Originally, the Dry Spirit Pill was not to be distributed today. However,
I heard there was a disciple promoted to the Outer Sect this month,
which makes me very happy. If we can do this every month, then
brilliant glory lies just around the corner for the Reliance Sect. I
bestow this pill upon that person as an encouragement.” Shangguan
Xiu smiled, and his glittering eyes swept across the crowd to fall upon
Meng Hao.
Meng Hao’s heart began to race. The first half of the short speech
had left him feeling unsettled, but he had no time to react; Shangguan
Xiu’s right hand flicked, and the purple pill appeared in front of him.

Before he could even make an attempt to refuse, the pill lowered into
his hand.
As of that moment, Meng Hao’s entrance into the Reliance Sect could
be called unprecedented.
The eyes of the entire crowd focused on him.
SOOYOuNA | 32
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Greed and cruelty filled their expressions, as if they planned to rip
him to pieces alive. Even the man and woman standing next to
Shangguan Xiu were staring. The woman had a look of shock on her
face, which she quickly covered up with an icy expression.
“Haha, so a first level Qi Condensation disciple receives the pill.
There will be a lot of fighting this time. This guy is going to be public
enemy number one.”
“He’s finished. Last time there was an Individual Pill Day, the guy who
received the pill was at the second level of Qi Condensation. He
hesitated for just a moment too long, so Elder Brother Zhao Wugang
[4] dragged him in a fury to the Public Area and lopped off his head.”
The sound of discussion reverberated across the square, and many
disciples of the second or third Qi Condensation level, despite
knowing the danger, grew greedy. Because the Cultivation base of
the person who received the pill was so weak, they felt as if they were
qualified to snatch it.
Meng Hao’s entire body broke out in a cold sweat. He wanted to
throw the pill away, but he found that it actually stuck to his hand,
making it impossible to get rid of. Around him, covetous eyes stared
at him menacingly, and suddenly, it was as if he could feel the

shadow of death hanging over him. Some people began to slowly
walk toward him, murderous expressions filling their faces.
“Junior Brother, why don’t you toss that pill to me? If you don’t, I’ll
give you a thrashing.”
“If you don’t give it to me, next year today will be the anniversary of
your death.”
The murmurs blasted at him like a cold wind from all directions.
At that moment, two old men sat cross-legged on one of the nearby
mountain peaks, smiling as they discussed the scene unfolding in the
Outer Sect Square.
“Master Shangguan really doesn’t pay attention to things. To give the
medicinal pill to a pup like that who just entered the Sect... He’s
finished. It seems our Reliance Sect will be short another disciple.”
“The fighting this time isn’t going to be interesting at all. I bet that as
soon as the restrictive fog dissipates from the square, the pup will
toss the pill.”
As soon as the second old man finished speaking, the nine colorful,
dragon-carved statues surrounding the square began to fade in color.
From the look of it, after the space of about ten SOOYOuNA | 33
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
breaths, they would be completely colorless. At that point, the
restrictive fog would also disappear.
Meng Hao’s heart began to pound. He didn’t need anyone to explain
to him what would happen when the glowing pillars grew dark. The
square would become a scene of madness. Even if he threw the pill
away, that in and of itself would make some of the people angry at
him.

“How... how could this be given to me?” said Meng Hao, sweating.
His mind began to spin. If he didn’t get rid of the pill, he would die; if
he did throw it away, he would become an object of hatred. Trying to
make use of all the knowledge he had acquired in his three years of
studying, he looked at the fading, colorful glow, and then at
Shangguan Xiu, who stood amidst the colorful fog on the platform,
preparing to leave. At this critical moment, Meng Hao suddenly had a
flash of inspiration.
He took a step forward and called out, “Disciple has something to
say.”
“Being able to come to the Reliance Sect and experience the
wonders of living amidst Immortals has been a wonderful stroke of
good fortune. Disciple would very much like to offer thanks to the one
person who made this possible.
“Disciple has been waiting day and night for another opportunity to
lay eyes on her, to offer thanks in person. Today, I finally have that
opportunity.” He talked faster and faster, and as he did so,
Shangguan Xiu stared in shock, no longer making his leave.
“That person is Elder Sister Xu. Elder Sister Xu, Junior Brother is
extremely appreciative of what you did, and is truly unable to pay you
back. I would like to offer this pill to you as a measure of my thanks to
you for giving me a new lease on life.” Meng Hao lifted up his right
hand, raising the medicinal pill up high.
Shangguan Xiu gaped, clearly never having imagined that Meng Hao
would say such a thing.
A strange expression appeared on his face, and he slowly smiled.
Standing next to him in her silver robe, Ms. Xu also stared in shock.
Even though she was still cold and detached, there was something
different about her expression now. Her Cultivation base was the
seventh level of Qi Condensation, thus the Dry Spirit Pills would not
be of much help to her. However, Dry Spirit Pills were still relatively

rare and not easy to acquire, even for her, a member of the Inner
Sect. If she took this pill and melded it together with a few other pills,
she could create a new pill worth five normal pills. For a moment, she
couldn’t help but palpitate with eagerness.
At this moment, even the man in the silver robe with the cool
expression looked down at Meng Hao.
Everyone was quiet. The Cultivators who had been advancing on
Meng Hao suddenly stopped in their tracks, strange expressions on
their faces. They stared at him with confusion.
SOOYOuNA | 34
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
After the brief silence, there was a sudden uproar.
“You can do this...?”
“To give away a medicinal pill in front of all these people, to an Inner
Sect disciple... who dares to fight for the pill now? That would
basically be picking a fight with the Inner Sect.”
“What a simple method! How come I never thought about that?
Dammit, dammit!”
“That freaking... I can’t believe I didn’t think of doing this that one
time. I was injured so badly I was bed-ridden for three months.”
The people staring at Meng Hao seemed to all have different feelings
on the matter. It was hard to say what had happened in ages past,
but as for the Cultivators here, they had never seen anyone deal with
a medicinal pill in this fashion. As of now, Meng Hao had been
indefinitely impressed onto everyone’s memories.
As of now, the dragon-carved pillars were completely colorless. The
pill still lay in Meng Hao’s outstretched palm, and yet no one moved

to take it. This was truly something rare to see in the Reliance Sect.
Ms. Xu’s expression had returned to normal. Without hesitation, her
right hand flashed downwards, and the medicinal pill flew from Meng
Hao’s hand into hers. Seeing the pill taken away, Meng Hao secretly
sighed. However, he knew that in his current state, it could only bring
him calamity. Around him, everyone else sighed, feeling angry at
Meng Hao. But, as soon as they thought of Elder Sister Xu, any such
anger dissipated.
Ms. Xu hesitated for a moment. Considering her status as an Inner
Sect disciple, it would be a bit improper to take something so valuable
from an Outer Sect disciple and not offer anything in return.
She was silent for a moment, then said, “Years ago, when I was a
member of the Outer Sect, an Immortal’s Cave was bestowed to me. I
shall lend it to you to live in.” She reached into her bag of holding and
pulled out a white jade slip. She tossed it down toward Meng Hao and
he grabbed it from the air.
“Elder Sister Xu’s Immortal’s Cave... this fellow really got lucky. They
say there’s a lot of spiritual energy in there, more than anywhere else
in the Sect.”
SOOYOuNA | 35
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
“Elder Sister Xu says she’s going to lend it, but she’s obviously just
giving it to him. She just used the word lend so that everyone
wouldn’t think too much. This kid really did the right thing in giving her
the pill.”
“Dammit, I wish I had thought of this back then.”
Just then, back atop the mountain peaks outside the Outer Sect were
the two gray-robed old men who had been betting on the

proceedings. Tall and grand, their eyes glittered brightly with praise.
They laughed heartily.
“This kid is pretty interesting. He just entered the Sect, but already
knows that he should find someone to rely on. Don’t tell me he has
innate instincts... Very good, splendid. He comprehends the true
meaning of the Reliance Sect. This kid isn’t bad. He really isn’t bad!”

CHAPTER 6: THE DELIGHTS OF THE COPPER MIRROR

Elder Sister Xu was quite well known in the Reliance Sect. In fact,
you could say that everyone knew her, because as of now, the
Reliance Inner Sect only had two disciples.
Other than Elder Sister Xu, the only other disciple was the man
currently standing next to Shangguan Xiu.
After Elder Sister Xu lent him her Immortal’s Cave, it had a fearinspiring effect on everyone, allowing Meng Hao to leave the square
with the Spirit Stone and Spirit Condensation pills.
Everyone watched him as he left.
As he walked off into the distance, his back soaked with sweat, he felt
the glares behind him like invisible blades. They slowly dissipated as
he walked quickly away.
In the time it takes three incense sticks to burn, Meng Hao walked
without stopping. He didn’t return to his room in the Outer Sect, but
rather followed the white jade slip Elder Sister Xu had given him
toward the Southern Mountain. At the foot of the mountain, he located
the Immortal’s Cave.
Outside of the cave, two large stone slabs towered up next to the
mountain face. Everything was covered with green branches and
vines; it appeared to be an entirely unordinary place, very different
from Meng Hao’s previous two dwellings.
The surroundings here were peaceful and lush. Not far away, a
mountain spring flowed down, and the wind carried away the heat,
replacing it with cool, fresh air.
Meng Hao stood in front of the mouth of the Immortal’s Cave, looking
completely content.
Now he truly understood how precious such a cave could be, clearly
much more than any other dwelling place. No wonder all the other

Outer Sect disciples had looked so jealous and envious when Elder
Sister Xu lent it to him.
“This is a place for Immortals,” said Meng Hao. He waved his right
hand, and the slip of white jade flew forward to the cave’s green
stone door. It slapped onto the surface, and a buzzing sound filled the
air as the door slowly opened.
The Immortal’s Cave was not very big, and only had two rooms. One
room was for practicing cultivation, the other was sealed shut with a
stone door. Meng Hao entered, and the green stone door slowly
closed behind him. When it sealed, the white jade slip flew out and
into Meng Hao’s hand. Thereupon, a soft glow began to emanate
from the craggy stone ceiling.
SOOYOuNA | 37
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
The more he looked around, the more satisfied he felt. Finally, his
gaze fell upon the sealed stone door. Muttering to himself, he placed
the jade slip onto it, and the door slowly opened.
At that moment, an odor of thick spiritual energy suddenly wafted out.
Meng Hao looked into the stone room, his eyes wide with shock.
“Sister Xu’s Immortal’s Cave, this... this gift is just too valuable.” It
took a while for him to recover his composure. He stared blankly into
the stone room, at something that appeared to be the mouth of a
spring. Out of it gurgled pure spiritual energy, multicolored and
glowing as it curled up into the air. Who knew how long it had been
accumulating in the stone room. As soon as the door had opened, it
began to pour out, its aroma sweet in the nose and mouth.
Even just a whiff would fill you with energy.

“So it’s a Spirit Spring,” Meng Hao murmured. It was something else
he had never seen before, but had read about in the Qi Condensation
Manual. Some springs in the world were Spirit Springs, which had no
water. Instead, they flowed forth with spiritual energy. Not many
existed, and most were occupied by Cultivators, considering how
treasured was the spiritual energy they emitted.
The Spirit Spring was relatively small. When all its spiritual energy
came out, it was only slightly thicker than outside. To anyone above
the third level of Qi Condensation, it would not be very helpful. After
the third level, the spiritual energy required was just too much; thus, it
was only moderately useful.
Despite that, as far as Meng Hao was concerned, this gift was
incomparably valuable, even much more so than a Dry Spirit pill. With
this discovery, Meng Hao went nearly wild with joy.
With no time to think, he sat down cross-legged, closed his eyes, and
began his breathing exercises. After a few hours, the greater part of
the spiritual energy that had accumulated here was gone. Meng Hao
opened his eyes, and they flashed brilliantly.
“These few hours of meditation here were worth about a month of
Cultivation outside. This accumulation of spiritual energy took quite
some time to build up, and probably won’t be like this again. Even
still, practicing Cultivation in here, I will be able to achieve speed
that’s impossible in the outside world.” He sighed. Looking around, he
noticed that the walls were covered with strange markings that he
didn’t understand.
“The Spirit Spring can accumulate so much spiritual energy because
of these markings. Elder Sister Xu must have used this method to
build up energy then dispose of it all in one shot.”
Meng Hao thought for another moment, then had an inspiration. He
again sat down and began to do breathing exercises.

The night passed quickly, and as the sun rose the next morning,
Meng Hao opened his eyes.
The spiritual energy in the stone room was very thin. But the Spirit
Spring was still there. After some period of time passed, the spiritual
energy would surely build up again.
SOOYOuNA | 38
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Meng Hao took a moment to sense his cultivation level. It seemed
that he had made an advancement worth nearly two months.
“If I can practice Cultivation in this fashion a few more times, I should
be able to break through the first level of Qi Condensation and enter
the second!” He sucked in a breath, excited. He very much wanted to
break through the first level, because only by reaching the second
level of Qi Condensation could one unlock the first Immortal Skill in
the Qi Condensation Manual.
Thinking of Immortal Skills, Meng Hao left the stone room, closing the
stone door as if it were some type of jewel or treasure. He decided to
use Elder Sister Xu’s method. He wouldn’t stand guard next to the
Spirit Spring itself. He would just wait for some time to pass, then
come back to collect the spiritual energy.
Sitting there in the Immortal’s Cave, Meng Hao rubbed his stomach.
Thinking over the recent days, and looking down at his skinny belly,
he realized that he hadn’t eaten any wild animals recently. Not even
wild fruits.
After becoming an Outer Sect disciple, he thought to himself, he
hadn’t been eating as much as when he was a servant. As long as
you had enough Spirit Stones, you could take them to the Sect’s Pill
Cultivation Workshop to exchange them for Fasting Pills or Appetite
Control Pills. It was said that one drop of such a pill would prevent

hunger for days. Without them, people would have to spend time
worrying about finding food.
After thinking about it for a while, Meng Hao decided to go out for a
bit. The fresh wind blew past him into the surrounding jungle. As he
walked, he pulled the copper mirror out of his bag of holding, as had
become his custom.
By now, he was thoroughly convinced that the Treasure Pavilion
Brother had tricked him.
There was nothing unusual at all about this mirror. In more than half a
month of study, he hadn’t uncovered anything even slightly peculiar
about it.
“Sadly, I only have a half of a Spirit Stone in my bag of holding. I bet
I’ll need to use it to bribe him to let me exchange it.” He stretched his
hand into the bag to pull out the Spirit Stone, feeling a bit dejected.
He suddenly froze in place, lifting his head up when he noticed a
flash of color off in the distance in the jungle. It wasn’t moving very
fast. Meng Hao’s eyes glittered. Based on his experience in the past
months catching wild chickens, he knew exactly what it was. Wild
chicken.
Without time to think about shoving the copper mirror and Spirit Stone
back into the bag of holding, he shoved them into a pocket and
leaped forward. Ever since spiritual energy had SOOYOuNA | 39
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
appeared in his body, Meng Hao realized that he was much more
nimble than before. Despite still being somewhat frail, he now could
burst forth with explosive force.
Especially nowadays, after reaching the first level of Qi
Condensation, a leap like the one he just made propelled him forward

very quickly. In the space of about ten breaths, he was able to snatch
the alarmed wild chicken. He clasped it by the two wings so that it
couldn’t move about.
“I wonder how good old Fatty is doing recently,” he said, thinking
about the fat teenager as he lifted up the chicken. Maybe he would go
find him and share a meal of wild game. Just as he turned, he
suddenly felt something inside his robe growing hot.
Moments later, the previously quiet chicken in his hand started to
struggle wildly and emit miserable squawking sounds. It moved
around with such energy than Meng Hao almost couldn’t keep hold of
it.
The wild chicken struggled even fiercerly, squawking with
incomparable shrillness. Then, a popping sound could be heard
coming from its butt, which then suddenly exploded, sending blood
and gore flying in all directions.
Everything happened so suddenly. Meng Hao stood there gaping.
Ever since arriving on the mountain, he had caught quite a few wild
chickens. But this was the first time he had seen anything like this. He
looked down with shock at the dead chicken and its exploded rear.
Then he looked around. Everything was still and quiet. Not even a
shadow moved.
“What just happened?” Meng Hao shivered. The wild chicken’s death
had been quite miserable.
It must have experienced incredible pain for its butt exploded.
Meng Hao took in a deep breath, suppressing the anxiety he felt. The
wild chicken’s death had been too odd and horrific. He felt as if a cold
wind was blowing down his back.
“Something’s not right,” said Meng Hao. He tossed away the dead
chicken, and then pulled out the mirror and the Spirit Stone. He

remembered that just before the strange thing had happened with the
chicken, something in his robe had started to grow hot.
“Could it be the Spirit Stone...” Then his eyes fell onto the copper
mirror. His heart began to beat faster and a powerful radiance shone
forth in his eyes.
“Don’t tell me...” The hand holding the mirror began to tremble. He
had no time to go eat with the fat teenager. Gripping the mirror, he
ran as fast as possible into the jungle, trying to find another wild
animal. He needed to know if the wild chicken’s killer really was the
mirror.
SOOYOuNA | 40

He didn’t have to run for very long before a wild deer appeared right
in front of him. It stood there looking at him stupidly, then angrily.
Meng Hao immediately shined the mirror onto it.
The deer’s expression changed immediately. It leaped to flee, calling
out miserably, in a heart-rending fashion difficult to describe. Anyone
who heard it could only imagine how miserable the creature must be.
Meng Hao could clearly see the animal’s flank as it leaped into the
air.
Before it could land, its butt exploded with a bang, its body twitching
as it fell.
Looking at the dead deer, then back at the mirror, an unprecedented
look of excitement appeared on Meng Hao’s face.
“What a treasure! A real treasure!!
“It’s so strange. A treasure that explodes the butts of wild animals...”
Even though he didn’t understand it completely, he was still very

excited. Regardless of why the treasure did this, he had an itching
desire to go test it out on some more animals.
SOOYOuNA | 41

CHAPTER 7: I NEED SPIRIT STONES!
As he walked, he grew more and more excited. The road he walked
was filled with blood and gore...
The blood and gore of scores of wild animals, whose butts had
exploded violently.
“Bang!” Another furry animal in front of him screamed shrilly as an
invisible attack struck its rear end, three times, until it exploded,
sending a mist of blood spraying into the air.
“Boom!” A foraging giant condor, not even landed on the ground yet,
shrieked miserably, as if it were experiencing a nightmare. Then its
butt exploded.
“Bang, boom.” That was a fierce, human-sized tiger that had been
about to pounce on Meng Hao. In mid-air, it emitted a terrifying roar
that changed into a horrific squeal, whereupon its butt blew open,
showering gore and blood everywhere. Perhaps because it had so
much fur, it actually exploded five times in succession.
“What a treasure. What a mighty treasure.” Before he knew it, dusk
had fallen, and Meng Hao’s expression could not be more excited. He
looked down at the copper mirror. Throughout the day, he had
exploded the rear ends of over one hundred animals.
Fortunately, he was out in the multitudinous wild mountains,
otherwise the stench of the blood and gore would be overwhelming.

“The mirror isn’t completely effective, though. When I tried it out on
that python, and the fish, it didn’t do anything at all. It seems it doesn’t
work on animals with scales. But it’s still awesome.” He had tested it
out in many ways and had discovered that it didn’t work when inside
the bag of holding. It only worked when he held it. He also got a
strange, excited feeling when it was at work exploding wild animals’
rear ends. It also looked like the corrosion was beginning to fade, as
if it had been hidden away for years and finally was able to stretch its
legs.
As dusk fell, Meng Hao found himself some distance out in the wild
mountains. The night wind blew, and he took in a deep, excited
breath. He was just getting ready to head back to the Immortal’s
Cave. After all, these mountains were filled with wild animals. Meng
Hao had even heard that demonic beasts that practiced cultivation
lived out here. Despite his excitement, he also knew that it could be
dangerous.
SOOYOuNA | 42
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
He had come to this place while searching for wild animals, so the
going had been slow. But on the way back, he could go much more
quickly. Meng Hao sped along through the wooded mountains, and
before long, a bright moon hung high in the sky. Soon, he could see
that only three mountains lay between him and the Immortal’s Cave.
Suddenly, he felt a hot wind on his face, accompanied by an acrid
odor. He stopped, his heart thumping, then retreated a few steps.
Roar!
As soon as he stepped back, the air about him shook with a mighty
roar, and once again the hot wind and acrid odor swept over him.
There in front of him was a monkey-like creature about the size of a
human. Its red eyes radiated cruelty, and its entire body was covered
with thick, luxuriant fur.

The fierce beast gave Meng Hao a bloodthirsty stare. Meng Hao’s
expression changed as he looked back at the creature. His mind
reeled, as if he were about to be blown away by the creature’s gaze.
He could sense the creature’s Cultivation base fluctuating.
“Second level of Qi Condensation!” Meng Hao took another step
back, his expression horrified.
This was no wild beast; it was a demonic beast. It must have been
attracted by the reek of blood from all the slain animals.
There was no time for him to think. The long-furred monkey-like
demonic beast leaped into the air, and then suddenly, its entire body
was covered in fire, a fire that did not singe its fur in the least. It shot
toward Meng Hao.
At this critical juncture, Meng Hao’s expression changed. He wasn’t
sure if the copper mirror would be effective against the demonic
beast, but there was no time for consideration. Even as it leaped into
the air, he ducked to the side, pulled out the mirror, and shined it
toward the demonic beast.
Then a miserable scream filled the air. In mid-air, a geyser of blood
shot out of the demonic beast’s butt. Its face twisted in horror, its eyes
no longer filled with cruelty, but rather confusion. It was as if in the
beast’s entire life, it had never experienced anything so painful....
But, it didn’t retreat. Moments later, more blood exploded out.
Now the confusion in its expression turned into complete
astonishment. It stared in horror at the mirror held in the hands of the
young man standing in front of it. It turned, covering its rear end with
its claws. The fire went out, and it made to flee, but before it could go
more than a handful of meters, its butt exploded again, this time, five
explosions in succession. Its screams rang out as it ran about thirty
more meters. Meng Hao felt the copper mirror trembling as if with

excitement. A powerful boom rang out, shooting straight toward the
demonic beast’s rear end.
SOOYOuNA | 43
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
An incomprehensible scream rang out over the wild mountains as half
of the demonic beast’s body exploded. A cloud of blood and gore
shot up, then slowly descended to the ground.
Confusion filled its face as it gasped a few last breaths, then died.
Everything had happened so fast. The entire time, Meng Hao just
stood there gaping. Finally, he took a breath, then looked down at the
mirror, panting.
“Even demonic beasts can’t avoid having their rear ends exploded.
This mirror...” In his excitement, Meng Hao felt even more awe. He
put it away, then looked over at the corpse of the demonic beast, his
heart thumping.
“The Qi Condensation Manual has an introduction to demonic beasts.
It says that they have a Demonic Core inside their bodies which
contains spiritual energy. I should be able to just eat it.” He quickly
walked over to the corpse. Sure enough, in the abdomen of the
creature he found a pristine Demonic Core, about the size of a
fingernail. It emitted a delicate, fragrant aroma which left him feeling
extremely comfortable.
Having retrieved the Demonic Core, Meng Hao hurried along his way.
Unfortunately, demonic creatures were not common in these parts.
He didn’t see any more on his way back to the Immortal’s cave. He
felt a little disappointed.
By the time he got back, it was deep into the night. He sat down
cross-legged and looked at the Demonic Core and the copper mirror,

his eyes shining.
“I can just eat the Demonic Core, but I still have the Spirit
Condensation Pill that the Sect distributed. I’ll take that first, then take
the Demonic Core.” His mind set, Meng Hao put the Demonic Core
and the copper mirror down next to him, as well as the Spirit Stone.
With the Spirit Stone at his side, it would allow him to absorb a little
more spiritual energy.
Next, he took out the Spirit Condensation Pill and swallowed it down.
As soon as it entered his body, strands of spiritual energy began to
spread out slowly. Meng Hao rotated his Cultivation base, quickly
absorbing the power of the medicinal pill.
When he opened his eyes an hour later, they glittered brightly. Taking
this pill was definitely much faster than actually practicing cultivation,
he thought to himself. Unfortunately, the Spirit Condensation Pill just
did not have enough energy. There wasn’t anything he could do
about that, though. His gaze shifted to the side and he picked up the
Demonic Core and popped it into his mouth.
As soon as it entered his body, spiritual energy far outmatching that
of the Spirit Cultivation Pill poured into him. It was almost too much to
take in. He quickly rotated his Cultivation base and poured the energy
into it. His body began to tremble, and strands of filth were pushed
out of his pores. Eight or ten hours later, his head buzzed, and he felt
as if his body would begin to SOOYOuNA | 44
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
float. Now, there was not a strand of spiritual energy inside him. The
strand had fused to form a stream.
“Spiritual energy like a stream, the body excretes the mortal filth.
This... Don’t tell me this is the second level of Qi Condensation?”
Meng Hao opened his eyes. They shined with an indescribable
expression. He looked down at his body, then cast his senses inside

and took a long moment to examine himself carefully. Sure enough,
he had broken through the first level of Qi Condensation into the
second.
“Demonic Cores really are incredibly effective.” Meng Hao’s eyes
sparkled. He stood and strolled around the Immortal’s Cave, enjoying
the feel of the stream-like spiritual energy circulating through his
body. He was incredibly happy.
“I am now a second level Qi Condensation Immortal!
“Too bad Demonic Cores are so rare. Otherwise, I would be able to
practice Cultivation much more quickly. And it’s all thanks to my
treasured mirror.” Meng Hao looked at the mirror.
When he did, his body suddenly trembled, and he unconsciously
rubbed his eyes. He looked even more closer, an incredulous
expression filling his face.
The copper mirror lay there just like before. But there was no Spirit
Stone on top of it. Instead, there was a Demonic Core!
“This... this...” Meng Hao’s brain spun, filled with confusion. He felt as
if he had lost his mind.
He stared mutely at the Demonic Core sitting on top of the copper
mirror and began to hesitate. He had placed a Demonic Core and a
Spirit Stone onto the mirror. He remembered clearly. But, he had
eaten the Demonic Core already. Suddenly, he wasn’t so sure. Had
he eaten the Demonic Core? Or had he eaten the Spirit Stone?
“I couldn’t have eaten the Spirit Stone...” Meng Hao gaped for some
time then slowly picked up the Demonic Core. He hesitated, then put
it in front of his mouth and sniffed. The smell made him certain; what
he had eaten moments ago was definitely a Demonic Core.

“What... what’s going on? There’s another one? Don’t tell me I was
mistaken, and the demonic beast actually had two Demonic Cores in
it?” Meng Hao’s felt even more confused. He shook his head, forcing
himself to clear his thoughts. He looked at the Demonic Core, then
the copper mirror. His body began to tremble and his eyes shone with
an incredible brilliance, as if he had just glimpsed ten thousand
pieces of gold. It seemed as if he would drop the Demonic Core at
any moment.
“Could it be... the mirror absorbed the Spirit Stone and produced a
second Demonic Core!” His voice quavered. He originally felt that the
mirror’s ability to explode wild beasts was powerful enough. He had
never imagined that it would have an even more profound ability.
SOOYOuNA | 45
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
After a while, he recovered a bit, although his heart was still filled with
a multitude of thoughts.
Right now, he didn’t have a Spirit Stone to test out, so his heart was
filled with anxiety. He was filled with an aching desire to get one to
experiment with.
“Spirit Stones. I need Spirit Stones!” His eyes shone like a ferocious
wild beast. At this moment, Spirit Stones were more valuable than
gold in his eyes. His desire for them was even stronger than his
previous desire to become an official.
Spirit Stones are indispensable to Cultivators, especially Meng Hao.
When worrying about personal gains and losses, one’s heart will be
filled with nervousness and anxiety. As of now, Meng Hao’s desire to
acquire Spirit Stones was stronger than anything he had ever
experienced.

Unfortunately, the Reliance Sect was a small Sect. Other than the
monthly Pill Distribution Day, there were almost no chances to get
them, other than by taking them from others.
“There’s one month until the next Pill Distribution Day.” Meng Hao
looked at the copper mirror, and his expression grew ferocious.
Moments later, the ferocity disappeared, hidden away. Right now, his
Cultivation base was only at the second level of Qi Condensation.
Even if he wanted to take something by force, he wouldn’t be a match
for anyone.
“Back in Yunjie County, I had no money,” said Meng Hao helplessly.
“Now I’m an Immortal, and I still have no money.” In his mind, he
pondered how he could get his hands on more Spirit Stones.
SOOYOuNA | 46
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
CHAPTER 8: ZHAO WUGANG
“It’s only one more month, but during that month, I must fight to
increase my Cultivation base one step further.” He carefully put the
copper mirror back into the bag of holding. He knew that he could not
let anyone know of its abilities. If he did, it would be difficult for him to
keep ahold of it, and he would surely lose his life in the process.
He looked down at himself, and the filth that covered him. In his
excitement, he had almost forgotten about his dirty state. But now, he
had calmed down quite a bit. He walked out of the Immortal’s cave to
the nearby stream and washed off the grime and impurities.
By the time he returned, the sky was growing light. He took out the Qi
Condensation Manual and began to study it.
“Upon reaching the second level of Qi Condensation, one can use
Immortal Skills. Upon reaching the fifth level, one can study Wind

Walking technique, which is an Immortal Skill similar to flying.” Meng
Hao closed his eyes, feeling thorough anticipation regarding the Wind
Walking technique of the fifth level of Qi Condensation.
In that instant, he suddenly felt the temperature increase rapidly
within the Immortal’s cave.
Then, tongues of fire appeared on his right hand. Considering that he
still thought like a mortal, seeing this caused his heart and mind to
feel great excitement, which in turn extinguished the flames.
Meng Hao promptly calmed himself and rotated his Cultivation base.
Unfortunately, by the time afternoon arrived, after dozens of attempts,
he still could do nothing more than produce a few sparks, whereupon
the spiritual energy in his body would disperse.
“It’s difficult to use this Flame Serpent art,” said Meng Hao with a
frown. But he had a persistent personality and would not be
discouraged easily, so he practiced breathing exercises for a while
before trying again.
Night fell, and then dawn came again. For two days Meng Hao tried
again and again, failing each time, until he became completely
exhausted. When the spiritual energy dispersed he would do
breathing exercises, and the resolve in his eyes would grow stronger
and stronger.
“I can’t believe I can’t use the Flame Serpent art!” said Meng Hao,
grinding his teeth and slapping his palm against the bag of holding.
Moments later, the Demonic Core appeared in his hand.
SOOYOuNA | 47
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
He knew that if he consumed the Core, and the mirror really had
some other fantastic properties, then later when he had enough Spirit

Stones, he would lack an original with which to make copies.
“Oh well, no need to worry about such details. Worst case scenario, I
go back out into the mountains to look for demonic beasts.” He
hesitated for a moment, then popped the Demonic Core into his
mouth, closed his eyes, and began his breathing exercises. Spiritual
energy exploded inside of him, pouring into every corner of his body.
Time passed, and soon it was afternoon. Meng Hao opened his eyes,
and they flashed. His Cultivation base was still at the second level but
was definitely much stronger.
“I think with three or maybe five more, I can reach the third level of Qi
Condensation.” He felt somewhat disappointed, realizing that the
higher his Cultivation base, the more difficult it would be to make
progress. But anticipation filled his heart when he thought of the
copper mirror. He raised his hand into the air and made a fist.
As he raised his fist, flames appeared, congealing on his right arm
and creating a small flaming serpent as long as a finger, which
radiated an oppressing heat. Meng Hao felt the spiritual energy in his
body instantly reduced by thirty percent.
His face grew pale, but understanding flashed in his eyes and he
smiled. He leaped out of the Immortal’s Cave and waved his right
hand. The Flame Serpent flew, slamming into a nearby tree.
A banging sound rang out, and the entire tree was engulfed in flame,
and within moments had collapsed into ashes.
“I have to find a chance to do this in front of Fatty. He’ll definitely
praise me then.” He smiled broadly, feeling quite heroic.
Half a month’s time passed, during which Meng Hao searched the
mountains for demonic beasts and trained his Flame Serpent art. He
worked harder than he had in his secular studies, and soon was quite
proficient with it, and was also able to reduce the amount of spiritual

energy it used. But it still required considerable effort over the space
of about ten breaths to be able to form it.
He also went into the Outer Sect and secretly tried the mirror out on
some of the disciples.
However, there was no reaction whatsoever. After a few tries, Meng
Hao concluded that the copper mirror only worked on excessively
furred creatures. A bit of a pity, but the mirror was still more powerful
than he could have ever wished for.
SOOYOuNA | 48
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Unfortunately, during the half month that passed, he never came
across any demonic creatures, and his Cultivation base became
mostly stagnant. Thankfully, every time after he practiced the Flame
Serpent art, his Cultivation base would grow a little bit during the
recovery period. However, he did not dare to engage in such practice
in the wild mountains. Only in the Immortal’s Cave.
“There are ten more days until Pill Distribution Day. I’m going to go
further out into the mountains.” Having made his decision, Meng Hao
departed early in the morning, heading quickly out into the deep
mountains.
He didn’t rest during the day, and by the time night fell, he’d forgotten
how many mountain chains he’d passed through. Finally, at the foot
of a black mountain, he ran into a bear-shaped demonic beast.
During the battle, he used the Flame Serpent art and the powerful
copper mirror. A series of five explosions were followed by a
miserable, reverberating scream, whereupon the creature died in a
pool of blood.

He took its Core, and was about to head further along the black
mountain when suddenly, the hairs on his body stood on end. Some
distance ahead of him had appeared five demonic beasts with the
heads of elephants and bodies of tigers. They stared at him, eyes
cold.
With the mirror, he could easily handle one demonic beast. But five
would be very difficult. He slowly retreated backwards, his right hand
clutching the mirror tightly.
Suddenly, a massive roar sounded out from the trees covering the
black mountain. It grew in intensity until it was like a huge explosion
seething in the air. Meng Hao’s expression changed, and he ran
away as fast as possible, without the slightest intention of slowing
down even a bit.
Fortunately, the five demonic beasts didn’t pursue him, and he soon
disappeared into the mountains.
“That cry sounded similar to when Uncle Shangguan called out. It
seems there are a lot of demonic beasts in that black mountain, even
Greater demonic beasts.” As he sped along, he looked back at the
black mountain, more and more convinced of what a dangerous place
it was.
Ten days passed by quickly. With the black mountain as his boundary,
Meng Hao ventured into the mountains but didn’t come across any
more demonic beasts. The Bear Demonic Core in his bag of holding
seemed more and more precious, so he didn’t eat it.
SOOYOuNA | 49
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
Pill Distribution Day arrived, and the sound of bells filled the air. Meng
Hao left the Immortal’s Cave and entered the Outer Sect. When he
had departed a month ago, his Cultivation base was the first level of

Qi Condensation, and now it was the second. Even though he was
some distance from the third level, he speculated that if the copper
mirror was as effective as he imagined, in the future he would
progress by leaps and bounds.
As fearful as ever about suffering a loss, Meng Hao entered the Pill
Distribution Square. Many of the disciples looked at him as he
entered, obviously recognizing him.
His actions the previous month had caused quite a shock to the Outer
Sect. Even though his cultivation level was low, and a month had
passed, the matter had been discussed quite a bit.
This time, it was not Shangguan Xiu who presided, but another
middle-aged man. Like last time, he distributed a Spirit Cultivation Pill
and half a Spirit Stone. But there was no Individual Pill distribution
this time.
As soon as the pill and the Spirit Stone were in his bag of holding,
and the pillars grew dark, Meng Hao left as quickly as possible, not
hesitating a moment. As he left, his eyes swept across the square,
and he saw quite a few Cultivators blocking fellow disciples to take
medicinal pills and Spirit Stones.
Elder Sister Xu’s blessing still seemed to have an effect. Coupled with
his quick departure, the only thing he received was a few cold stares.
No one attempted to take anything from him.
He breathed a sigh of relief. He was well aware that Elder Sister Xu’s
name could only protect him for so long. This month was fine, but in a
few more months, someone would surely make a move against him.
“As long as the copper mirror works, in a few months... we’ll see who
will be snatching from whom!” Eyes glittering, he lowered his head
and walked a bit faster.

He left the Outer Sect, eager to try out the copper mirror, walking as
fast as possible back towards the Immortal’s Cave. When the cave
was not far off, he suddenly stopped in his tracks, his pupil’s
narrowing. A person had just walked out of the jungle.
He wore a green robe and looked to be about twenty-four or twentyfive years of age. He had an arrogant look on his fierce face as he
stood there staring coldly at Meng Hao. His Cultivation base was not
that of an ordinary person. It was the third level of Qi Condensation.
The man stood there, blocking Meng Hao’s way.
“Greetings, Elder Brother Zhao,” said Meng Hao, his expression
changing as he took a few steps back. He moved his left hand behind
his back, and began moving about in the air. He had seen
SOOYOuNA | 50
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
this person before. Just about everyone in the Outer Sect knew Elder
Brother Zhao Wugang.
He was cruel and ruthless, and quite a few low-level disciples had
died by his hand in the Public Zone. He was the kind of person to
ingratiate himself to disciples above the third level, but lord it over the
first and second levels.
“So, you’ve heard of me,” said Zhao Wugang coldly. “I don’t need to
make any more introductions. Hand over your medicinal pill and Spirit
Stone.” Others didn’t dare to even touch Meng Hao, but Zhao
Wugang had entered the Sect years ago and knew how things
worked. Elder Sister Xu often secluded herself, ignoring the lives of
the people beneath her.
“Elder Brother Zhao, can’t you make an exception?” said Meng Hao,
taking a few steps back.

“I... I’m just a simple scholar, and I just got the Spirit Stone and
medicinal pill. Can’t you give me a bit of time with them?” This
person’s cultivation level was greater than his by more than an entire
level. Furthermore, he had never fought anyone before. His face grew
pale from fear.
“You call yourself a scholar?” He sneered, then laughed loudly. “Don’t
tell me you were a scholar before you came here? Come, come,
recite some poetry for your Elder Brother. Maybe you’ll lighten my
mood and I won’t beat you and break your legs.”
“Elder Brother Zhao...” Meng Hao was extremely nervous, and quite
angry as well, but he had no choice but to hold on and try to talk
some sense into the man. “The sages said, if...”
“Shut up. I’ll take not only your medicinal pill and Spirit Stone, but the
Immortal’s Cave as well.
From now on, we are fellow disciples in the outside world, but in the
cave, you will be my servant. If you say even one more word, I’ll help
you to understand the meaning of the expression ‘death is better than
life!’” Glaring murderously, he began walking toward Meng Hao.
His Cultivation base had already broken through to the third level,
and needed large amounts of spiritual energy. So of course he had
taken a fancy to Meng Hao’s Immortal’s Cave. However, he still
feared Elder Sister Xu, so he had come up with the idea to keep him
as a servant. After some time passed, Elder Sister Xu would surely
forget the nobodies beneath her, and he could just kill Meng Hao. Or
if he didn’t kill him, he could cripple him and force him to stick around
reciting poetry to show how elegant Zhao Wugang was.
“The Immortal’s Cave belongs to Elder Sister Xu. How could I act as
her agent? Elder Brother Zhao, please don’t make things so hard for
me.” Behind his back, strands of spiritual energy had collected in
Meng Hao’s right hand. He knew that he wasn’t a match for Zhao
Wugang, but the Immortal’s Cave was just too important, and the

Spirit Stone even more so. There was no way he would hand it over.
Therefore, his heart filled with uncertainty and anger, he used the
name of Elder Sister Xu.
“I give you some face and you ignore it,” said Zhao Wugang with a
snort. “You’re just looking for trouble. I’ll definitely teach you what it
means to prefer death over life!” An impatient SOOYOuNA | 51
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
expression on his face, he raced toward Meng Hao, his outstretched
hands twisting like claws.
Meng Hao looked completely shocked and frightened, which Zhao
Wugang liked. He enjoyed seeing such looks on the face of people
weaker than him.
He could just imagine Meng Hao dropping to the ground in front of
him, trembling. Just when he was feeling most proud of himself, right
before he reached Meng Hao, Meng Hao’s horrified expression
disappeared, to be replaced with sternness. He flung his right hand
out from behind his back, and a burning, finger-long Flame Serpent
shot toward Zhao Wugang.
Meng Hao’s heart thumped furiously. He knew that the Flame Serpent
art was not strong enough to kill his opponent, but he still hoped that
it would at least slow him down. He could not bear to be captured,
much less hand over all his possessions and become a servant. He
would flee into the mountains in an instant if he could.
“Flame Serpent art!” Zhao Wugang’s expression changed, and he
retreated backwards. His hand slapped his bag of holding and
produced a small white sword, which he threw toward the Flame
Serpent.
There was a bang, and the Flame Serpent disappeared. The white
sword had been twisted and bent, so he kicked it aside into the

jungle. Looking quite embarrassed, Zhao Wugang continued to move
backwards, watching as Meng Hao fled into the mountains. He was
both furious and astonished.
“He reached the second level of Qi Condensation so quickly,” said
Zhao Wugang furiously.
“Elder Sister Xu’s Immortal’s Cave really is effective. It seems I must
kill this guy.” He raced off in pursuit.
After pursuing him for a bit, he found that Meng Hao was much more
familiar with this part of the mountain than him. Furthermore, he ran
very quickly. Zhao Wugang was having trouble catching him.
“You little bastard,” called Zhao Wugang in a sinister voice. “There’s
no one out here in these mountains. Do you want to die? I’m gonna
finish you!” Considering how quickly Meng Hao was running, he
decided that it was time to use one of his more powerful techniques.
He roared, and his body expanded, the hair on his body growing thick
and golden-colored. Some of the hair even stuck out through his
clothing. It looked as if he had transformed into something like a
demonic beast.
This was a technique he had picked up before joining the Sect: the
Were-demon skill.
It was a skill which could be cultivated after reaching the second level
of Qi Condensation, but the demonic transformation was not very
obvious. The body grew bigger and stronger, and SOOYOuNA | 52
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
more frightening. Such a skill would allow him to rampage among
lower-level disciples. He could only use this skill for a limited time, but
it was quite effective. His killing trump card.

Now that his Cultivation base had reached the third level of Qi
Condensation, the skill was even more fully developed. Being able to
grow such thick, golden fur was a pleasant surprise.
Being able to shapeshift into a demonic form like this would enable
him to easily shock his opponents. He brimmed with confidence, his
thick, golden fur shining brightly, mighty and domineering. Fur even
grew from his face. He looked exactly like a human-shaped demonic
beast.
“You will be the first person to die under my Were-demon skill! How
just and fair!”
SOOYOuNA | 53
I SHALL SEAL THE HEAVENS BOOK 01: PATRIARCH RELIANCE
CHAPTER 9: PATIENCE AND FRUSTRATION
Using this technique at the third level allowed Zhao Wugang to
increase his strength by several degrees, as well as his speed.
Grinning hideously, face full of greed, he charged toward Meng Hao,
sharp claws glittering in the sunlight.
He brimmed with confidence, certain that Meng Hao’s fear would
break him. Flee he might, but escape he could not.
“Run,” laughed Zhao Wugang with a ferocious smile, his powerful
voice reverberating through the air. “You can’t escape the skills of
Zhao Wugang.”
When Zhao Wugang shapeshifted into demonic form, Meng Hao was
fleeing up ahead. He saw what happened out of the corner of his eye,
and a look of surprise filled his face. But then, it seemed he’d thought
of something, and a different, stranger expression replaced the
surprise.

This demonic form looked exactly like the forms of the various beasts
that had been exploded by the copper mirror. In fact, he had even
more radiant fur covering his body than those other beasts had.
Meng Hao looked carefully at Zhao Wugang, the strange expression
still covering his face. The thick, golden fur made him look like some
sort of king of beasts.
When Zhao Wugang saw the look on Meng Hao’s face, he felt
astonished. When he had broken through to the third level of Qi
Condensation, he had tried out the Were-demon form, but this was
the first time he had revealed it to another person. Meng Hao’s
strange expression irritated him. He let out a cold harrumph, and a
murderous look appeared in his eyes.
“I think... you’ll probably like this copper mirror,” said Meng Hao.
Seeing Zhao Wugang’s speed increase so much in his Were-demon
form, he realized that he would close the distance between them
rapidly. He took a few steps back and slapped the bag of holding with
his right hand. Instantly, the copper mirror appeared. With the strange
expression still covering his face, he shined the mirror onto Zhao
Wugang in all his arrogant splendor.
As soon as the mirror began to shine, Meng Hao felt it begin to emit a
burning heat that he had never felt before. This was a much stronger
reaction than when it had encountered other demonic beasts, as if
some sort of powerful thirst had been unleashed within it. At that
moment, a sort of invisible aura burst forth from the mirror and shot
forward.
Zhao Wugang leaped toward Meng Hao, his aura radiating murder
and ferocity. Suddenly, he felt strange, as if some sort of gas had
entered his body. It roiled violently within him, and from the outside it
looked as if the aura was trying to claw its way out. Zhao Wugang’s
expression SOOYOuNA | 54

changed. He felt severe pain in his organs, which quickly rose to a
critical level. Without thinking, he pushed the aura down to his
dantian region, in order to force it out.
The aura was powerful, and it seemed to be seeking a weak spot in
his body to emerge from.
When he pushed the aura down toward his dantian, it rushed directly
toward his buttocks, and in an instant, exploded out with violent, gutwrenching pain. Zhao Wugang let out an uncontrollable, bloodcurdling scream.
He had never made such a sound before in his life, because never
before had he experienced something like this. His body began to
tremble, and he glared wrathfully at Meng Hao. The murder in his
bloodshot eyes grew fiercer.
“Elder Brother Zhao,” said Meng Hao, his heart thumping. This was
the first time he had ever fought someone. “Why don’t we end things
here? If you don’t make things hard for me, I won’t make things hard
for you. A happy ending.” He clamped his hand over the mirror. The
sound of his opponents scream had unsettled him. He couldn’t take it.
After all, this was a person, not a demonic beast.
“You little bastard!” shouted Zhao Wugang. “Today, I’m not just going
to kill you; I’m going to go down the mountain, find your family and kill
them too! I’ll humiliate your entire clan!” The pain had caused him to
nearly go mad. His eyes burned, and with a roar, he pounced toward
Meng Hao, sharp claws preparing to rip him to shreds.
Meng Hao was just a scholar, and had never been in a fight. But he
possessed courage, and hearing Zhao Wugang say such things
caused murderous intent to shine in his eyes. There was no point in
trying to talk reason to a person who clearly wanted to provoke him.
He couldn’t bear to hear the miserable screams, but hearing such
threats would cause anyone to lose their temper. He took a few steps
back and unflinchingly held up the mirror.

As Zhao Wugang approached, he felt something roaring toward him.
Once again, the terrifying aura entered his body. Considering what he
had just experienced, he protected himself, sealing off the aura so it
couldn’t escape. But just when he was feeling confident in his
success, it shot through his body, rumbling, then exploded out of his
left ear.
The pain was many times more severe than before, and he let out a
horrible, shrill shriek that was impossible to describe. Then, his right
ear exploded, showering out blood.
His head felt as if it were about to split down the middle, and his face
had grown pale white.
Dumb with astonishment, he stared at Meng Hao. Then his face filled
with monstrous savagery.

“I will kill your entire family, and then eliminate your whole clan! I’ll
make them all feel pain like this, then let them die screaming!”
Enduring the pain, and also deaf, he leaped toward Meng Hao, filled
with insane determination to kill his opponent.
“I give you face and you ignore it!” said Meng Hao, gaping. He had
never seen the mirror explode an ear before. Looking stern, he
retreated further, again shining the mirror onto Zhao Wugang.
“Meng Hao!!” screamed Zhao Wugang, his right ear exploding into
shreds. Both ears swelled.
His expression was no longer one of ferocious rage but rather
astonishment and dread. He turned, faster than he had ever turned in
his life, and made to flee, having lost any desire to mess with Meng
Hao. But the fear in his heart caused him to tremble so violently that

he couldn’t even flee. Instead, he focused, and once again,
summoned his desire to kill. He would inflict pain on Meng Hao’s
family, and also take away that damned copper mirror.
However, even as he turned, the mirror, for the first time ever, flew out
of Meng Hao’s hands.
It seemed its interest had been aroused. It flew after Zhao Wugang,
attacking him multiple times. Zhao Wugang’s eyes filled with
desperation; it appeared as if some incredible power had entered his
body. He screamed uncontrollably, unable to flee. Something tossed
him into the air and his left ear, right ear, chest and legs all exploded
violently.
As the aura exploded out, it sent mists of blood into the air, and in the
space of time it takes to breathe ten times, Zhao Wugang’s eyes grew
dark, and his body slowly shifted from Were-demon form back to
normal. The fur disappeared, and seemingly because of this, the
copper mirror lost interest and flew back to Meng Hao. Zhao
Wugang’s body dropped to the ground.
Blood covered everything. Zhao Wugang’s dead eyes still shone with
horror and despair.
Anyone who laid eyes upon him would surely tremble.
Looking at Zhao Wugang’s corpse, Meng Hao sucked in a deep
breath. The copper mirror flew back into his hand, whereupon his
body shook. Awe and veneration filled his eyes. Seeing some wild
animals explode was not a big deal, but this time it had been a living
person. Seeing the blood and gore everywhere, he trembled. The
stench of death on the mirror caused him to want to get rid of the
mirror. He loosened his hand and tossed it to the ground.
He was just a scholar, after all. The mirror had seemed interesting at
first, but now it seemed incredibly gruesome, and conflicted with the
Confucian ideals which Meng Hao believed in.

He stood in silence for some time, feeling flustered at heart. The
frustration could be seen in his eyes. In his heart, he was still a
scholar from Yunjie County. He spoke the truth to people, and had
never been in a fight, let alone killed anyone. That behavior was
deeply rooted in his heart, and could not easily be changed. As he
contemplated the situation, his heart struggled.

“The etiquette, happiness, kindness and justice of Confucianism, and
its search for truth, demands a refraining from killing. But the Sect
says ‘the strong shall prey on the weak.’ Now I understand the truth
of that saying, but to actually put it into practice is different...”
Trembling, Meng Hao felt frightened even just thinking about what
had happened. After a long time, he let out a long sigh and started to
walk off.
But having taken only a few steps, he ground his teeth, turned, and
walked back to Zhao Wugang’s corpse. He picked up his bag of
holding, then summoned a Flame Serpent and placed it onto the
body.
The fire didn’t completely eat up the corpse, so Meng Hao consumed
a Spirit Condensation Pill, then shot three more Flame Serpents
down. Soon the corpse had withered up to the point where it was
unrecognizable.
He did some breathing exercises, gritted his teeth, then shot down
two more Flame Serpents.
Now, the corpse was completely ash.
Glancing at the mirror on the ground, he clenched his jaw, walked
over, and picked it up, gripping it firmly.

Still feeling conflicted and afraid, Meng Hao left, walking back to the
Immortal’s Cave as quickly as possible. He sat in a daze. For a long
time he just sat there, before finally moving again to open Zhao
Wugang’s bag of holding. When he saw what was inside, his eyes
glittered.
The dark mood caused by his first kill suddenly changed.
“This guy was so rich,” he exclaimed, sucking in a breath. The bag of
holding contained eight Spirit Stones, seven Spirit Condensing Pills
and a bone fragment covered with strange symbols.
He looked at the bone fragment, then immediately tossed it aside. It
described the Were-demon technique. He didn’t dare to even touch it.
He didn’t want to turn into a Were-demon and then be destroyed by
his own copper mirror.
As he tossed the bone chip aside, he suddenly remembered the
flying sword. He immediately walked out of the cave and tracked it
down in the jungle. He lifted up the short white sword and returned to
the cave to examine it, eyes glittering.
Meng Hao couldn’t think of how to reconcile the differences between
the ways of Immortals and the path of Confucius. He decided to stop
thinking about the matter. Maybe he would understand it one day, but
for now, the most important thing was to figure out a way to stay alive
in the Sect.

Eyes filled with resolve, he took the Spirit Stones out and felt them.
Then he pulled out the copper mirror and put it down next to him,
looking at it for some time.

“Elder Brother Zhao provoked me,” he murmured. “I had to strike
back. I tried to smooth things out, but he refused. I killed someone,
but I tried to be reasonable. I tried to be kind, but he rushed into
death.
“The mirror reeks of blood. In the hands of an evildoer, it would be a
tool of evil, but in my hands, it will be different. I have Confucian
kindness in my heart, and this treasure is mine. It will be different.” He
looked down at the mirror and took a deep breath.
“It doesn’t just explode things, and doesn’t just seek blood. In the
future, I will use it carefully.”
He muttered to himself like this for some time, then lifted his head,
thinking about the other mystery of the mirror, and his hope. He
ground his teeth.
“Success or failure. Now we’ll see. If it’s a success, then Meng Hao’s
